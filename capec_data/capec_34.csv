34,HTTP Response Splitting,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary manipulates and injects malicious content, in the form of secret unauthorized HTTP responses, into a single HTTP response from a vulnerable or compromised back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server) or into an already spoofed HTTP response from an adversary controlled domain/site.

The intended consequences of the malicious HTTP request and the subsequent adversary injection and manipulation of HTTP responses to intermediary and front-end client/victim HTTP agents, will be observed to confirm applicability of identified vulnerabilities in the adversary's plan of attack.:TECHNIQUE:Continue the monitoring of HTTP traffic.:TECHNIQUE:Utilize different sequences of special characters (CR - Carriage Return, LF - Line Feed, HT - Horizontal Tab, SP - Space and etc.) to bypass filtering and back-end encoding and to embed: additional HTTP Requests with their own headers malicious web scripts into parameters of HTTP Request headers (e.g., browser cookies like Set-Cookie or Ajax web/browser object parameters like XMLHttpRequest) adversary chosen encoding (e.g., UTF-7) to utilize additional special characters (e.g., > and <) filtered by the target HTTP agent. Note that certain special characters and character encoding may be applicable only to intermediary and front-end agents with rare configurations or that are not RFC compliant.:TECHNIQUE:Follow an unrecognized (sometimes a RFC compliant) HTTP header with a subsequent HTTP request to potentially cause the HTTP request to be ignored and interpreted as part of the preceding HTTP request.::STEP:1:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Perform HTTP Response Splitting attack] Using knowledge discovered in the experiment section above, smuggle a message to cause one of the consequences.:TECHNIQUE:Leverage techniques identified in the Experiment Phase.::","::A vulnerable or compromised server or domain/site capable of allowing adversary to insert/inject malicious content that will appear in the server's response to target HTTP agents (e.g., proxies and users' web browsers).::Differences in the way the two HTTP agents parse and interpret HTTP requests and its headers.::HTTP headers capable of being user-manipulated.::HTTP agents running on HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 that allow for Keep Alive mode, Pipelined queries, and Chunked queries and responses.::","::SKILL:Detailed knowledge on HTTP protocol: request and response messages structure and usage of specific headers.:LEVEL:Medium::SKILL:Detailed knowledge on how specific HTTP agents receive, send, process, interpret, and parse a variety of HTTP messages and headers.:LEVEL:Medium::SKILL:Possess knowledge on the exact details in the discrepancies between several targeted HTTP agents in path of an HTTP message in parsing its message structure and individual headers.:LEVEL:Medium::","::Tools capable of monitoring HTTP messages, and crafting malicious HTTP messages and/or injecting malicious content into HTTP messages.::",::Differences in responses processed by the two agents with multiple responses to a single request in the web logs.

Since the contents of the user-supplied session ID are not validated, it is possible to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response body. This immediately enables HTTP Response Splitting by simply terminating the HTTP response header from within the session ID used in the Set-Cookie directive.
