321,TCP Sequence Number Probe,Detailed,Stable,"This OS fingerprinting probe tests the target system's assignment of TCP sequence numbers. One common way to test TCP Sequence Number generation is to send a probe packet to an open port on the target and then compare the how the Sequence Number generated by the target relates to the Acknowledgement Number in the probe packet. Different operating systems assign Sequence Numbers differently, so a fingerprint of the operating system can be obtained by categorizing the relationship between the acknowledgement number and sequence number as follows: 1) the Sequence Number generated by the target is Zero, 2) the Sequence Number generated by the target is the same as the acknowledgement number in the probe, 3) the Sequence Number generated by the target is the acknowledgement number plus one, or 4) the Sequence Number is any other non-zero number.",,Medium,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:312::,,"::The ability to monitor and interact with network communications.Access to at least one host, and the privileges to interface with the network interface card.::",,::A tool capable of sending and receiving packets from a remote system.::,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities::,,,::200::,,,
