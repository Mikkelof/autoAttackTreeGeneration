528,XML Flood,Standard,Draft,"An adversary may execute a flooding attack using XML messages with the intent to deny legitimate users access to a web service. These attacks are accomplished by sending a large number of XML based requests and letting the service attempt to parse each one. In many cases this type of an attack will result in a XML Denial of Service (XDoS) due to an application becoming unstable, freezing, or crashing.",::TERM:XML Denial of Service (XML DoS):DESCRIPTION:::,Low,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:125::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Survey the target] Using a browser or an automated tool, an attacker records all instance of web services to process XML requests.:TECHNIQUE:Use an automated tool to record all instances of URLs to process XML requests.:TECHNIQUE:Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how the application processes XML requests.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:An adversary crafts input data that may have an adverse effect on the operation of the web service when the XML data sent to the service.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Launch a resource depletion attack] The attacker delivers a large number of XML messages to the target URLs found in the explore phase at a sufficiently rapid rate. It causes denial of service to the target application.:TECHNIQUE:Send a large number of crafted XML messages to the target URL.::",::The target must receive and process XML transactions.::An adverssary must possess the ability to generate a large amount of XML based messages to send to the target service.::,::SKILL:Denial of service:LEVEL:Low::,,::A large amount of data is passed to the XML parser possibly making it crash or otherwise unavailable to end users.::,::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Resource Consumption::,::Design: Build throttling mechanism into the resource allocation. Provide for a timeout mechanism for allocated resources whose transaction does not complete within a specified interval.::Implementation: Provide for network flow control and traffic shaping to control access to the resources.::,"::Consider the case of attack performed against the createCustomerBillingAccount Web Service for an online store. In this case, the createCustomerBillingAccount Web Service receives a huge number of simultaneous requests, containing nonsense billing account creation information (the small XML messages). The createCustomerBillingAccount Web Services may forward the messages to other Web Services for processing. The application suffers from a high load of requests, potentially leading to a complete loss of availability the involved Web Service.::",::770::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1499.002:ENTRY NAME:Endpoint Denial of Service:Service Exhaustion Flood::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1498.001:ENTRY NAME:Network Denial of Service:Direct Network Flood::,,
