87,Forceful Browsing,Standard,Draft,"An attacker employs forceful browsing (direct URL entry) to access portions of a website that are otherwise unreachable. Usually, a front controller or similar design pattern is employed to protect access to portions of a web application. Forceful browsing enables an attacker to access information, perform privileged operations and otherwise reach sections of the web application that have been improperly protected.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:115::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Spider] Using an automated tool, an attacker follows all public links on a web site. They record all the links they find.:TECHNIQUE:Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links.:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Attempt well-known or guessable resource locations] Using an automated tool, an attacker requests a variety of well-known URLs that correspond to administrative, debugging, or other useful internal actions. They record all the positive responses from the server.:TECHNIQUE:Use a spidering tool to follow and record attempts on well-known URLs.:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of attempts on well-known URLs.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Use unauthorized resources] By visiting the unprotected resource, the attacker makes use of unauthorized functionality.:TECHNIQUE:Access unprotected functions and execute them.::STEP:4:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[View unauthorized data] The attacker discovers and views unprotected sensitive data.:TECHNIQUE:Direct request of protected pages that directly access database back-ends. (e.g., list.jsp, accounts.jsp, status.jsp, etc.)::",::The forcibly browseable pages or accessible resources must be discoverable and improperly protected.::,::SKILL:Forcibly browseable pages can be discovered by using a number of automated tools. Doing the same manually is tedious but by no means difficult.:LEVEL:Low::,"::None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack. A directory listing is helpful, but not a requirement.::",,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,"::Authenticate request to every resource. In addition, every page or resource must ensure that the request it is handling has been made in an authorized context.::Forceful browsing can also be made difficult to a large extent by not hard-coding names of application pages or resources. This way, the attacker cannot figure out, from the application alone, the resources available from the present context.::",::A bulletin board application provides an administrative interface at admin.aspx when the user logging in belongs to the administrators group. An attacker can access the admin.aspx interface by making a direct request to the page. Not having access to the interface appropriately protected allows the attacker to perform administrative functions without having to authenticate themself in that role.::,::425::285::693::,TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:34:ENTRY NAME:Predictable Resource Location::::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Attacks:ENTRY NAME:Forced browsing::,,
