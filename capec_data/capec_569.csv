569,Collect Data as Provided by Users,Standard,Draft,"An attacker leverages a tool, device, or program to obtain specific information as provided by a user of the target system. This information is often needed by the attacker to launch a follow-on attack. This attack is different than Social Engineering as the adversary is not tricking or deceiving the user. Instead the adversary is putting a mechanism in place that captures the information that a user legitimately enters into a system. Deploying a keylogger, performing a UAC prompt, or wrapping the Windows default credential provider are all examples of such interactions.",,,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:116::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:568::,,,,,,,,,,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1056:ENTRY NAME:Input Capture::,
