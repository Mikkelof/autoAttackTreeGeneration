622,Electromagnetic Side-Channel Attack,Detailed,Draft,"In this attack scenario, the attacker passively monitors electromagnetic emanations that are produced by the targeted electronic device as an unintentional side-effect of its processing. From these emanations, the attacker derives information about the data that is being processed (e.g. the attacker can recover cryptographic keys by monitoring emanations associated with cryptographic processing). This style of attack requires proximal access to the device, however attacks have been demonstrated at public conferences that work at distances of up to 10-15 feet. There have not been any significant studies to determine the maximum practical distance for such attacks. Since the attack is passive, it is nearly impossible to detect and the targeted device will continue to operate as normal after a successful attack.",,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:189::,,::Proximal access to the device.::,"::SKILL:Sophisticated attack, but detailed techniques published in the open literature.:LEVEL:Medium::",,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data:NOTE:Derive sensitive information about encrypted data.
