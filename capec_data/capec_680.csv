680,Exploitation of Improperly Controlled Registers,Detailed,Draft,An adversary exploits missing or incorrectly configured access control within registers to read/write data that is not meant to be obtained or modified by a user.,,Medium,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:1::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:180::,,::Awareness of the hardware being leveraged.::Access to the hardware being leveraged.::,::SKILL:Intricate knowledge of registers.:LEVEL:High::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::,::Design proper access control policies for hardware register access from software and ensure these policies are implemented in accordance with the specified design.::Ensure security lock bit protections are reviewed for design inconsistencies and common weaknesses.::Test security lock programming flow in both pre-silicon and post-silicon environments.::Leverage automated tools to test that values are not reprogrammable and that write-once fields lock on writing zeros.::Ensure that measurement data is stored in registers that are read-only or otherwise have access controls that prevent modification by an untrusted agent.::,"::During a System-on-Chip's (SoC) secure boot process, the code to be authenticated is measured to determine the code's validity. This entails the one-way hash of the code binary being calculated and extended to the previous hash. The value obtained after completion of the boot flow is then stored in a register with the intent of later verifying this value to determine if the boot flow has been tampered with. However, the register being used does not prevent an adversary from modifying the register's contents, which can result in the adversary spoofing the measurement data used in the attestation process.::",::1224::1231::1233::1262::1283::,,,
