194,Fake the Source of Data,Standard,Stable,"An adversary takes advantage of improper authentication to provide data or services under a falsified identity. The purpose of using the falsified identity may be to prevent traceability of the provided data or to assume the rights granted to another individual. One of the simplest forms of this attack would be the creation of an email message with a modified From field in order to appear that the message was sent from someone other than the actual sender. The root of the attack (in this case the email system) fails to properly authenticate the source and this results in the reader incorrectly performing the instructed action. Results of the attack vary depending on the details of the attack, but common results include privilege escalation, obfuscation of other attacks, and data corruption/manipulation.",,,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:151::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:275::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:543::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:544::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:598::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:633::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:697::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:657::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:667::,,"::This attack is only applicable when a vulnerable entity associates data or services with an identity.

Possible tools needed by an attacker could include tools to create custom network packets, specific client software, and tools to capture network traffic. Many variants of this attack require no attacker resources, however.::",,"::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:NOTE:By faking the source of data or services, an adversary can cause a target to make incorrect decisions about how to proceed.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges:NOTE:By impersonating identities that have an increased level of access, an adversary gain privilege that they many not have otherwise had.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities:NOTE:Faking the source of data or services can be used to create a false trail in logs as the target will associate any actions with the impersonated identity instead of the adversary.::",,,::287::,TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:38:ENTRY NAME:URL Redirector Abuse::,
