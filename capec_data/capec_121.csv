Other non-production interfaces can be executed using simple tools, such as web browsers or console windows. In some cases, an adversary may need to be able to authenticate to the target before it can access the vulnerable interface.::",,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authentication:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Data:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,::Ensure that production systems do not contain non-production interfaces and that these interfaces are only used in development environments.::,"::Some software applications include application programming interfaces (APIs) that are intended to allow an administrator to test and refine their domain.
