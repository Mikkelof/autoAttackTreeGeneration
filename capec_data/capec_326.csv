326,TCP Initial Window Size Probe,Detailed,Stable,This OS fingerprinting probe checks the initial TCP Window size. TCP stacks limit the range of sequence numbers allowable within a session to maintain the connected state within TCP protocol logic. The initial window size specifies a range of acceptable sequence numbers that will qualify as a response to an ACK packet within a session. Various operating systems use different Initial window sizes. The initial window size can be sampled by establishing an ordinary TCP connection.,,Medium,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:312::,,"::The ability to monitor and interact with network communications.Access to at least one host, and the privileges to interface with the network interface card.::",,::A tool capable of sending and receiving packets from a remote system.::,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities::,,,::200::,,,
