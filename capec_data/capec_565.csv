565,Password Spraying,Detailed,Draft,"In a Password Spraying attack, an adversary tries a small list (e.g. 3-5) of common or expected passwords, often matching the target's complexity policy, against a known list of user accounts to gain valid credentials. The adversary tries a particular password for each user account, before moving onto the next password in the list. This approach assists the adversary in remaining undetected by avoiding rapid or frequent account lockouts. The adversary may then reattempt the process with additional passwords, once enough time has passed to prevent inducing a lockout.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:49::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:151::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:560::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:561::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:600::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:653::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine target's password policy] Determine the password policies of the target system/application.:TECHNIQUE:Determine minimum and maximum allowed password lengths.:TECHNIQUE:Determine format of allowed passwords (whether they are required or allowed to contain numbers, special characters, etc., or whether they are allowed to contain words from the dictionary).:TECHNIQUE:Determine account lockout policy (a strict account lockout policy will prevent brute force attacks).::STEP:2:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Select passwords] Pick the passwords to be used in the attack (e.g. commonly used passwords, passwords tailored to individual users, etc.):TECHNIQUE:Select passwords based on common use or a particular user's additional details.:TECHNIQUE:Select passwords based on the target's password complexity policies.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Brute force password] Given the finite space of possible passwords dictated by information determined in the previous steps, try each password for all known user accounts until the target grants access.:TECHNIQUE:Manually or automatically enter the first password for each known user account through the target's interface. In most systems, start with the shortest and simplest possible passwords, because most users tend to select such passwords if allowed to do so.:TECHNIQUE:Iterate through the remaining passwords for each known user account.::",::The system/application uses one factor password based authentication.::The system/application does not have a sound password policy that is being enforced.::The system/application does not implement an effective password throttling mechanism.::The adversary possesses a list of known user accounts on the target system/application.::,::SKILL:A Password Spraying attack is very straightforward.

Password Spraying, leveraging a list of commonly used passwords, is used to crack this password and gain access to the account.::The Iranian hacker group APT33 (AKA Holmium, Refined Kitten, or Elfin) carried out numerous Password Spraying attacks in 2019. On average, APT33 targeted 2,000 organizations per month, with upwards of 10 million authentication attempts each day. The majority of these attacks targeted manufacturers, suppliers, or maintainers of industrial control system equipment.::",::521::262::263::654::307::308::309::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1110.003:ENTRY NAME:Brute Force:Password Spraying::,
