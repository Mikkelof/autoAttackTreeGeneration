445,Malicious Logic Insertion into Product Software via Configuration Management Manipulation,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary exploits a configuration management system so that malicious logic is inserted into a software products build, update or deployed environment. If an adversary can control the elements included in a product's configuration management for build they can potentially replace, modify or insert code files containing malicious logic. If an adversary can control elements of a product's ongoing operational configuration management baseline they can potentially force clients receiving updates from the system to install insecure software when receiving updates from the server.",,Medium,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:444::,,::Access to the configuration management system during deployment or currently deployed at a victim location. This access is often obtained via insider access or by leveraging another attack pattern to gain permissions that the adversary wouldn't normally have.::,,,,::SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::,::Assess software during development and prior to deployment to ensure that it functions as intended and without any malicious functionality.::Leverage anti-virus products to detect and quarantine software with known virus.::,"::In 2016, the policy-based configuration management system Chef was shown to be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks based on its Chef Manage add-on improperly deserializing user-driven cookie data. This allowed unauthenticated users the ability to craft cookie data that executed arbitrary code with the web server's privileges.
