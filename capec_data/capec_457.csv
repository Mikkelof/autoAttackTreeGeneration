457,USB Memory Attacks,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary loads malicious code onto a USB memory stick in order to infect any system which the device is plugged in to. USB drives present a significant security risk for business and government agencies. Given the ability to integrate wireless functionality into a USB stick, it is possible to design malware that not only steals confidential data, but sniffs the network, or monitor keystrokes, and then exfiltrates the stolen data off-site via a Wireless connection. Also, viruses can be transmitted via the USB interface without the specific use of a memory stick. The attacks from USB devices are often of such sophistication that experts conclude they are not the work of single individuals, but suggest state sponsorship. These attacks can be performed by an adversary with direct access to a target system or can be executed via means such as USB Drop Attacks.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:456::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:529::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine Target System] In certain cases, the adversary will explore an organization's network to determine a specific target machine to exploit based on the information it contains or privileges the main user may possess.:TECHNIQUE:If needed, the adversary explores an organization's network to determine if any specific systems of interest exist.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Develop or Obtain malware and install on a USB device] The adversary develops or obtains the malicious software necessary to exploit the target system, which they then install on an external USB device such as a USB flash drive.:TECHNIQUE:The adversary can develop or obtain malware for to perform a variety of tasks such as sniffing network traffic or monitoring keystrokes.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Connect or deceive a user into connecting the infected USB device] Once the malware has been placed on an external USB device, the adversary connects the device to the target system or deceives a user into connecting the device to the target system such as in a USB Drop Attack.:TECHNIQUE:The adversary connects the USB device to a specified target system or performs a USB Drop Attack, hoping a user will find and connect the USB device on their own.

Additionally, use an isolated testing machine to validate untrusted devices and confirm malware does not exist.::",,::1299::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1091:ENTRY NAME:Replication Through Removable Media::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1092:ENTRY NAME:Communication Through Removable Media::,
