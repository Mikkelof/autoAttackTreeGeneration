196,Session Credential Falsification through Forging,Standard,Draft,"An attacker creates a false but functional session credential in order to gain or usurp access to a service. Session credentials allow users to identify themselves to a service after an initial authentication without needing to resend the authentication information (usually a username and password) with every message. If an attacker is able to forge valid session credentials they may be able to bypass authentication or piggy-back off some other authenticated user's session. This attack differs from Reuse of Session IDs and Session Sidejacking attacks in that in the latter attacks an attacker uses a previous or existing credential without modification while, in a forging attack, the attacker must create their own credential, although it may be based on previously observed credentials.",,Medium,Medium,::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:384::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:61::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:21::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Analyze and Understand Session IDs] The attacker finds that the targeted application use session credentials to identify legitimate users.:TECHNIQUE:An attacker makes many anonymous connections and records the session IDs.:TECHNIQUE:An attacker makes authorized connections and records the session tokens or credentials.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Create Session IDs.] Attackers craft messages containing their forged credentials in GET, POST request, HTTP headers or cookies.:TECHNIQUE:The attacker manipulates the HTTP request message and adds their forged session IDs in to the requests or cookies.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Abuse the Victim's Session Credentials] The attacker fixates falsified session ID to the victim when victim access the system. Once the victim has achieved a higher level of privilege, possibly by logging into the application, the attacker can now take over the session using the forged session identifier.:TECHNIQUE:The attacker loads the predefined or predicted session ID into their browser and browses to protected data or functionality.:TECHNIQUE:The attacker loads the predefined or predicted session ID into their software and utilizes functionality with the rights of the victim.::",::The targeted application must use session credentials to identify legitimate users.

By choosing session identifiers that are sufficiently random, brute-forcing or guessing becomes very difficult.::Implementation: Regenerate and destroy session identifiers when there is a change in the level of privilege: This ensures that even though a potential victim may have followed a link with a fixated identifier, a new one is issued when the level of privilege changes.::","::This example uses client side scripting to set session ID in the victim's browser.
