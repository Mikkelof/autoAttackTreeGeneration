230,Serialized Data with Nested Payloads,Standard,Draft,"Applications often need to transform data in and out of a data format (e.g., XML and YAML) by using a parser. It may be possible for an adversary to inject data that may have an adverse effect on the parser when it is being processed. Many data format languages allow the definition of macro-like structures that can be used to simplify the creation of complex structures. By nesting these structures, causing the data to be repeatedly substituted, an adversary can cause the parser to consume more resources while processing, causing excessive memory consumption and CPU utilization.",::TERM:XML Denial of Service (XML DoS):DESCRIPTION:::,Medium,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:130::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:197::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:491::,::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:An adversary determines the input data stream that is being processed by a data parser that supports using substitution on the victim's side.::STEP:2:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:An adversary crafts input data that may have an adverse effect on the operation of the parser when the data is parsed on the victim's system.::,::An application's user-controllable data is expressed in a language that supports subsitution.::An application does not perform sufficient validation to ensure that user-controllable data is not malicious.::,,,"::Bad data is passed to the data parser (possibly repeatedly), possibly making it crash or execute arbitrary code.::",::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Resource Consumption::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges::,::Carefully validate and sanitize all user-controllable data prior to passing it to the data parser routine.
