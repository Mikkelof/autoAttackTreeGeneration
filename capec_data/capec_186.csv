186,Malicious Software Update,Standard,Draft,An adversary uses deceptive methods to cause a user or an automated process to download and install dangerous code believed to be a valid update that originates from an adversary controlled source.,,,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:184::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:98::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Identify target] The adversary must first identify what they want their target to be. Because malicious software updates can be carried out in a variety of ways, the adversary will first not only identify a target program, but also what users they wish to target. This attack can be targeted (a particular user or group of users) or untargeted (many different users).::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Craft a deployment mechanism based on the target] The adversary must craft a deployment mechanism to deploy the malicious software update. This mechanism will differ based on if the attack is targeted or untargeted.:TECHNIQUE:Targeted attack: hosting what appears to be a software update, then harvesting actual email addresses for an organization, or generating commonly used email addresses, and then sending spam, phishing, or spear-phishing emails to the organization's users requesting that they manually download and install the malicious software update.:TECHNIQUE:Targeted attack: Instant Messaging virus payload, which harvests the names from a user's contact list and sends instant messages to those users to download and apply the update:TECHNIQUE:Untargeted attack: Spam the malicious update to as many users as possible through unsolicited email, instant messages, or social media messages.:TECHNIQUE:Untargeted attack: Send phishing emails to as many users as possible and pretend to be a legitimate source suggesting to download an important software update.:TECHNIQUE:Untargeted attack: Use trojans/botnets to aid in either of the two untargeted attacks.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Deploy malicious software update] Using the deployment mechanism from the previous step, the adversary gets a user to install the malicious software update.::",,::SKILL:This attack requires advanced cyber capabilities:LEVEL:High::,::Manual or user-assisted attacks require deceptive mechanisms to trick the user into clicking a link or downloading and installing software. Automated update attacks require the adversary to host a payload and then trigger the installation of the payload code.::,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands:NOTE:Utilize the built-in software update mechanisms of the commercial components to deliver software that could compromise security credentials, enable a denial-of-service attack, or enable tracking.::",::Validate software updates before installing.::,::Using an automated process to download and install dangerous code was key part of the NotPeyta attack [REF-697]::,::494::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.002:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain::,"TYPE:Other:NOTE:Other class of attacks focus on firmware, where malicious updates are made to the core system firmware or BIOS. Since this occurs outside the controls of the operating system, the OS detection and prevention mechanisms do not aid, thus allowing an adversary to evade defenses as well as gain persistence on the target's system.::",
