438,Modification During Manufacture,Meta,Draft,"An attacker modifies a technology, product, or component during a stage in its manufacture for the purpose of carrying out an attack against some entity involved in the supply chain lifecycle. There are an almost limitless number of ways an attacker can modify a technology when they are involved in its manufacture, as the attacker has potential inroads to the software composition, hardware design and assembly, firmware, or basic design mechanics. Additionally, manufacturing of key components is often outsourced with the final product assembled by the primary manufacturer. The greatest risk, however, is deliberate manipulation of design specifications to produce malicious hardware or devices. There are billions of transistors in a single integrated circuit and studies have shown that fewer than 10 transistors are required to create malicious functionality.",,,,::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:444::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:447::,,,,,,,,,,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise::,
