Many standard web and application servers will perform this task on your behalf.::Implementation: If the identifier is used for authentication, such as in the so-called single sign on use cases, then ensure that it is protected at the same level of assurance as authentication tokens.::Implementation: If the web or application server supports it, then encrypting and/or signing the identifier (such as cookie) can protect the ID if intercepted.::Design: Use strong session identifiers that are protected in transit and at rest.::Implementation: Utilize a session timeout for all sessions, for example 20 minutes. If the user does not explicitly logout, the server terminates their session after this period of inactivity. If the user logs back in then a new session key is generated.::Implementation: Verify authenticity of all identifiers at runtime.::","::Thin client applications like web applications are particularly vulnerable to session ID attacks. Since the server has very little control over the client, but still must track sessions, data, and objects on the server side, cookies and other mechanisms have been used to pass the key to the session data between the client and server. When these session keys are compromised it is trivial for an adversary to impersonate a user's session in effect, have the same capabilities as the authorized user. There are two main ways for an adversary to exploit session IDs. A brute force attack involves an adversary repeatedly attempting to query the system with a spoofed session header in the HTTP request. A web server that uses a short session ID can be easily spoofed by trying many possible combinations so the parameters session-ID= 1234 has few possible combinations, and an adversary can retry several hundred or thousand request with little to no issue on their side. The second method is interception, where a tool such as wireshark is used to sniff the wire and pull off any unprotected session identifiers. The adversary can then use these variables and access the application.::For example, in a message queuing system that allows service requesters to post messages to its queue through an open channel (such as anonymous FTP), authorization is done through checking group or role membership contained in the posted message. However, there is no proof that the message itself, the information in the message (such group or role membership), or the process that wrote the message to the queue is authentic and authorized to do so.::",::290::302::346::539::6::384::664::602::642::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1134:ENTRY NAME:Access Token Manipulation::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1528:ENTRY NAME:Steal Application Access Token::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1539:ENTRY NAME:Steal Web Session Cookie::,
