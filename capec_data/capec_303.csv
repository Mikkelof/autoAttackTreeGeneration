303,TCP Xmas Scan,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary uses a TCP XMAS scan to determine if ports are closed on the target machine. This scan type is accomplished by sending TCP segments with all possible flags set in the packet header, generating packets that are illegal based on RFC 793. The RFC 793 expected behavior is that any TCP segment with an out-of-state Flag sent to an open port is discarded, whereas segments with out-of-state flags sent to closed ports should be handled with a RST in response. This behavior should allow an attacker to scan for closed ports by sending certain types of rule-breaking packets (out of sync or disallowed by the TCB) and detect closed ports via RST packets.",,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:300::,::STEP:1:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:An adversary sends TCP packets with all flags set but not associated with an existing connection to target ports.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:An adversary uses the response from the target to determine the port's state. If no response is received the port is open. If a RST packet is received then the port is closed.::,"::The adversary needs logical access to the target network. XMAS scanning requires the use of raw sockets, and thus cannot be performed from some Windows systems (Windows XP SP 2, for example). On Unix and Linux, raw socket manipulations require root privileges.::",,"::This attack can be carried out with a network mapper or scanner, or via raw socket programming in a scripting language. Packet injection tools are also useful for this purpose. Depending upon the method used it may be necessary to sniff the network in order to see the response.::",,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Unreliable Execution::,::Employ a robust network defensive posture that includes a managed IDS/IPS.::,,::200::,,"TYPE:Other:NOTE:Many operating systems do not implement RFC 793 exactly and for this reason XMAS scans do not work as expected against these devices. Some operating systems, like Microsoft Windows, send a RST packet in response to any out-of-sync (or malformed) TCP segments received by a listening socket (rather than dropping the packet via RFC 793), thus preventing the adversary from distinguishing between open and closed ports. XMAS scans are limited by the range of platforms against which they work.::",
