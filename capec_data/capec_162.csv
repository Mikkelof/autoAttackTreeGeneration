162,Manipulating Hidden Fields,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary exploits a weakness in the server's trust of client-side processing by modifying data on the client-side, such as price information, and then submitting this data to the server, which processes the modified data. For example, eShoplifting is a data manipulation attack against an on-line merchant during a purchasing transaction. The manipulation of price, discount or quantity fields in the transaction message allows the adversary to acquire items at a lower cost than the merchant intended. The adversary performs a normal purchasing transaction but edits hidden fields within the HTML form response that store price or other information to give themselves a better deal. The merchant then uses the modified pricing information in calculating the cost of the selected items.",,,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:77::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Probe target web application] The adversary first probes the target web application to find all possible pages that can be visited on the website.:TECHNIQUE:Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application.::STEP:2:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Find hidden fields] Once the web application has been traversed, the adversary looks for all hidden HTML fields present in the client-side.:TECHNIQUE:Use the inspect tool on all modern browsers and filter for the keyword hidden:TECHNIQUE:Specifically look for hidden fields inside form elements.::STEP:3:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Send modified hidden fields to server-side] Once the adversary has found hidden fields in the client-side, they will modify the values of these hidden fields one by one and then interact with the web application so that this data is sent to the server-side. The adversary observes the response from the server to determine if the values of each hidden field are being validated.::STEP:4:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Manipulate hidden fields] Once the adversary has determined which hidden fields are not being validated by the server, they will manipulate them to change the normal behavior of the web application in a way that benefits the adversary.:TECHNIQUE:Manipulate a hidden field inside a form element and then submit the form so that the manipulated data is sent to the server.::",::The targeted site must contain hidden fields to be modified.::The targeted site must not validate the hidden fields with backend processing.::,,::The adversary must have the ability to modify hidden fields by editing the HTTP response to the server.::,,,,,::602::,,
