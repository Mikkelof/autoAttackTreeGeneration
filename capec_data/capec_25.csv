25,Forced Deadlock,Meta,Stable,"The adversary triggers and exploits a deadlock condition in the target software to cause a denial of service. A deadlock can occur when two or more competing actions are waiting for each other to finish, and thus neither ever does. Deadlock conditions can be difficult to detect.",,Low,High,,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:The adversary initiates an exploratory phase to get familiar with the system.::STEP:2:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:The adversary triggers a first action (such as holding a resource) and initiates a second action which will wait for the first one to finish.::STEP:3:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:If the target program has a deadlock condition, the program waits indefinitely resulting in a denial of service.::","::The target host has a deadlock condition. There are four conditions for a deadlock to occur, known as the Coffman conditions.

Client applications using the database may require exclusive access to a table, and in order to gain exclusive access they ask for a lock. If one client application holds a lock on a table and attempts to obtain the lock on a second table that is already held by a second client application, this may lead to deadlock if the second application then attempts to obtain the lock that is held by the first application (Source: Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock)::",::412::567::662::667::833::1322::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1499.004:ENTRY NAME:Endpoint Denial of Service: Application or System Exploitation::,,
