175,Code Inclusion,Meta,Stable,"An adversary exploits a weakness on the target to force arbitrary code to be retrieved locally or from a remote location and executed. This differs from code injection in that code injection involves the direct inclusion of code while code inclusion involves the addition or replacement of a reference to a code file, which is subsequently loaded by the target and used as part of the code of some application.",,Medium,Very High,::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:251::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:253::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:234::,,"::The target application must include external code/libraries that are executed when the application runs and the adversary must be able to influence the specific files that get included.::The victim must run the targeted application, possibly using the crafted parameters that the adversary uses to identify the code to include.::",,::The adversary may need the capability to host code modules if they wish their own code files to be included.::,,,,::One example of this type of attack pattern is PHP file include attacks where the parameter of an include() function is set by a variable that an attacker is able to control. The result is that arbitrary code could be loaded into the PHP application and executed.::,::829::,,
