600,Credential Stuffing,Standard,Stable,"An adversary tries known username/password combinations against different systems, applications, or services to gain additional authenticated access. Credential Stuffing attacks rely upon the fact that many users leverage the same username/password combination for multiple systems, applications, and services.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:560::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:16::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:49::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:50::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:55::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:70::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:101::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:565::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:568::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:151::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:653::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Acquire known credentials] The adversary must obtain known credentials in order to access the target system, application, or service.:TECHNIQUE:An adversary purchases breached username/password combinations or leaked hashed passwords from the dark web.:TECHNIQUE:An adversary leverages a key logger or phishing attack to steal user credentials as they are provided.:TECHNIQUE:An adversary conducts a sniffing attack to steal credentials as they are transmitted.:TECHNIQUE:An adversary gains access to a database and exfiltrates password hashes.:TECHNIQUE:An adversary examines outward-facing configuration and properties files to discover hardcoded credentials.::STEP:2:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine target's password policy] Determine the password policies of the target system/application to determine if the known credentials fit within the specified criteria.:TECHNIQUE:Determine minimum and maximum allowed password lengths.:TECHNIQUE:Determine format of allowed passwords (whether they are required or allowed to contain numbers, special characters, etc., or whether they are allowed to contain words from the dictionary).:TECHNIQUE:Determine account lockout policy (a strict account lockout policy will prevent brute force attacks if multiple passwords are known for a single user account).::STEP:3:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Attempt authentication] Try each username/password combination until the target grants access.:TECHNIQUE:Manually or automatically enter each username/password combination through the target's interface.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Impersonate] An adversary can use successful experiments or authentications to impersonate an authorized user or system or to laterally move within a system or application::STEP:4:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Spoofing] Malicious data can be injected into the target system or into a victim user's system by an adversary.

An adversary obtains a victim's username/password combination from a breach of a social media application and executes a Credential Stuffing attack against multiple banking and credit card applications. Since the user leverages the same credentials for their bank account login, the adversary successfully authenticates to the user's bank account and transfer money to an offshore account.::In October 2014 J.P. Morgan's Corporate Challenge website was breached, resulting in adversaries obtaining multiple username/password pairs. A Credential Stuffing attack was then executed against J.P.
