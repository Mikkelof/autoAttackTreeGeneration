300,Port Scanning,Standard,Stable,An adversary uses a combination of techniques to determine the state of the ports on a remote target. Any service or application available for TCP or UDP networking will have a port open for communications over the network.,,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:169::,,::The adversary requires logical access to the target's network in order to carry out this type of attack.::,,"::The adversary requires a network mapping/scanning tool, or must conduct socket programming on the command line. Packet injection tools are also useful for this purpose. Depending upon the method used it may be necessary to sniff the network in order to see the response.::",,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities::,,,::200::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1046:ENTRY NAME:Network Service Scanning::,"TYPE:Other:NOTE:There are four types of port status that this type of attack aims to identify: 1) Open Port: The port is open and a firewall does not block access to the port, 2) Closed Port: The port is closed (i.e. no service resides there) and a firewall does not block access to the port, 3) Filtered Port: A firewall or ACL rule is blocking access to the port in some manner, although the presence of a listening service on the port cannot be verified, and 4) Unfiltered Port: A firewall or ACL rule is not blocking access to the port, although the presence of a listening service on the port cannot be verified.::",
