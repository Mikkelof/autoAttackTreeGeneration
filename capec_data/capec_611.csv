611,BitSquatting,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary registers a domain name one bit different than a trusted domain. A BitSquatting attack leverages random errors in memory to direct Internet traffic to adversary-controlled destinations. BitSquatting requires no exploitation or complicated reverse engineering, and is operating system and architecture agnostic. Experimental observations show that BitSquatting popular websites could redirect non-trivial amounts of Internet traffic to a malicious entity.",,Low,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:616::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:89::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:543::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine target website] The adversary first determines which website to impersonate, generally one that is trusted and receives a consistent amount of traffic.:TECHNIQUE:Research popular or high traffic websites.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Impersonate trusted domain] In order to impersonate the trusted domain, the adversary needs to register the BitSquatted URL.:TECHNIQUE:Register the BitSquatted domain.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Wait for a user to visit the domain] Finally, the adversary simply waits for a user to be unintentionally directed to the BitSquatted domain.:TECHNIQUE:Simply wait for an error in memory to occur, redirecting the user to the malicious domain.::","::An adversary requires knowledge of popular or high traffic domains, that could be used to deceive potential targets.::",::SKILL:Adversaries must be able to register DNS hostnames/URLâ€™s.:LEVEL:Low::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Depending on the intention of the adversary, a successful BitSquatting attack can be leveraged to execute more complex attacks such as cross-site scripting or stealing account credentials.::","::Authenticate all servers and perform redundant checks when using DNS hostnames.::When possible, use error-correcting (ECC) memory in local devices as non-ECC memory is significantly more vulnerable to faults.::",,,,,
