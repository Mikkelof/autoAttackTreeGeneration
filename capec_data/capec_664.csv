664,Server Side Request Forgery,Standard,Stable,"An adversary exploits improper input validation by submitting maliciously crafted input to a target application running on a server, with the goal of forcing the server to make a request either to itself, to web services running in the server’s internal network, or to external third parties. If successful, the adversary’s request will be made with the server’s privilege level, bypassing its authentication controls. This ultimately allows the adversary to access sensitive data, execute commands on the server’s network, and make external requests with the stolen identity of the server. Server Side Request Forgery attacks differ from Cross Site Request Forgery attacks in that they target the server itself, whereas CSRF attacks exploit an insecure user authentication mechanism to perform unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:115::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:122::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:126::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:161::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:253::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:309::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Find target application] Find target web application that accepts a user input and retrieves data from the server::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Examine existing application requests] Examine HTTP/GET requests to view the URL query format.

It specifically targets the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol used by various network devices and gaming consoles. To execute the attack, an adversary performs a scan of the LAN to discover UPnP enabled devices, and subsequently a list of UPnP services they use. Once the UPnP service endpoints are listed, a vulnerability in the UPnP protocol is used to send these endpoints as encrypted to a verification server via the UPnP Callback method. Because the encryption is done on the client side, the server returns an encrypted list of services which is decrypted on the client side. The adversary then has a list of services running the vulnerable UPnP protocol, which the adversary can leverage to make spoofed requests. [REF-646]::",::918::20::,,
