270,Modification of Registry Run Keys,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary adds a new entry to the run keys in the Windows registry so that an application of their choosing is executed when a user logs in. In this way, the adversary can get their executable to operate and run on the target system with the authorized user's level of permissions. This attack is a good way for an adversary to run persistent spyware on a user's machine, such as a keylogger.",,Medium,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:203::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:555::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:529::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:568::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:646::,::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine target system] The adversary must first determine the system they wish to target. This attack only works on Windows.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Gain access to the system] The adversary needs to gain access to the system in some way so that they can modify the Windows registry.:TECHNIQUE:Gain physical access to a system either through shoulder surfing a password or accessing a system that is left unlocked.:TECHNIQUE:Gain remote access to a system through a variety of means.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Modify Windows registry] The adversary will modify the Windows registry by adding a new entry to the run keys referencing a desired program. This program will be run whenever the user logs in.::,::The adversary must have gained access to the target system via physical or logical means in order to carry out this attack.::,,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Data:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges::,::Identify programs that may be used to acquire process information and block them by using a software restriction policy or tools that restrict program execution by using a process allowlist.::,::An adversary can place a malicious executable (RAT) on the target system and then configure it to automatically run when the user logs in to maintain persistence on the target system.::Through the modification of registry run keys the adversary can masquerade a malicious executable as a legitimate program.::,::15::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1547.001:ENTRY NAME:Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Start Folder::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1547.014:ENTRY NAME:Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Active::,
