641,DLL Side-Loading,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary places a malicious version of a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) in the Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) directory to trick the operating system into loading this malicious DLL instead of a legitimate DLL. Programs specify the location of the DLLs to load via the use of WinSxS manifests or DLL redirection and if they aren't used then Windows searches in a predefined set of directories to locate the file. If the applications improperly specify a required DLL or WinSxS manifests aren't explicit about the characteristics of the DLL to be loaded, they can be vulnerable to side-loading.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:159::,,::The target must fail to verify the integrity of the DLL before using them.::,::SKILL:Trick the operating system in loading a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate DLL.:LEVEL:High::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,::Prevent unknown DLLs from loading through using an allowlist policy.::Patch installed applications as soon as new updates become available.::Properly restrict the location of the software being used.::Use of sxstrace.exe on Windows as well as manual inspection of the manifests.::Require code signing and avoid using relative paths for resources.::,,::706::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1574.002:ENTRY NAME:Hijack Execution Flow:DLL Side-Loading::,,
