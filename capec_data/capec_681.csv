The access-policy register determines which agents may access the AES-key registers, based on a corresponding security identifier. It is assumed the system has two agents: a Main-controller and an Aux-controller, with respective security identifiers 1 and 2. The Main-controller (ID 1) is meant to have access to the AES-key registers, while the Aux-controller (ID 2) has access to the access-policy register. If a SoC incorrectly generates security identifier 1 for both agents, then both agents will have access to the AES-key registers. This could further result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or the execution of an action that in turn could result in privilege escalation or unintended access.::",::1259::1267::1270::1294::1302::,,
