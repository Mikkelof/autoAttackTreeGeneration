425,Target Influence via Framing,Standard,Draft,"An adversary uses framing techniques to contextualize a conversation so that the target is more likely to be influenced by the adversary's point of view. Framing is information and experiences in life that alter the way we react to decisions we must make. This type of persuasive technique exploits the way people are conditioned to perceive data and its significance, while avoiding negative or avoidance responses from the target. Rather than a specific technique framing is a methodology of conversation that slowly encourages the target to adopt to the adversary's perspective. One technique of framing is to avoid the use of the word No and to contextualize responses in a manner that is positive. When performed skillfully the target is much more likely to volunteer information or perform actions favorable to the adversary.",,Low,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:416::,,::The adversary must have the means and knowledge of how to communicate with the target in some manner.::,::SKILL:The adversary requires strong inter-personal and communication skills.:LEVEL:Low::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Successful attacks that influence the target via framing into performing an action or sharing sensitive information can result in a variety of consequences that negatively affect the confidentiality of an application or system.::,"::An organization should provide regular, robust cybersecurity training to its employees to prevent social engineering attacks.::Avoid sharing unnecessary information during interactions beyond what is absolutely required for effective communication.::",,,,
