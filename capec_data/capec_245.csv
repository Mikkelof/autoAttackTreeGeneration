245,XSS Using Doubled Characters,Detailed,Draft,"The adversary bypasses input validation by using doubled characters in order to perform a cross-site scripting attack. Some filters fail to recognize dangerous sequences if they are preceded by repeated characters. For example, by doubling the < before a script command, (<<script or %3C%3script using URI encoding) the filters of some web applications may fail to recognize the presence of a script tag. If the targeted server is vulnerable to this type of bypass, the adversary can create a crafted URL or other trap to cause a victim to view a page on the targeted server where the malicious content is executed, as per a normal XSS attack.",,,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:588::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:591::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:592::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Survey the application for user-controllable inputs] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary follows all public links and actions on a web site. They record all the links, the forms, the resources accessed and all other potential entry-points for the web application.:TECHNIQUE:Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links and analyze the web pages to find entry points. Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL.:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application.:TECHNIQUE:Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browsers' plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the discovery.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Probe identified potential entry points for XSS using double characters] The adversary uses the entry points gathered in the Explore phase as a target list and injects various common script payloads modified to use double characters and doubled special characters to determine if an entry point actually represents a vulnerability and to characterize the extent to which the vulnerability can be exploited.:TECHNIQUE:Use a list of XSS probe strings using double characters to inject script in parameters of known URLs. If possible, the probe strings contain a unique identifier.:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record results of manual input of XSS probes in known URLs.:TECHNIQUE:Use a list of doubled HTML special characters to inject into parameters of known URLs and check if they were properly encoded, replaced, or filtered out.::STEP:3:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Craft malicious XSS URL] Once the adversary has determined which parameters are vulnerable to XSS, they will craft a malicious URL containing the XSS exploit. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from the victim.:TECHNIQUE:Execute a script using an expression embedded in an HTML attribute, which avoids needing to inject a script tag.:TECHNIQUE:Send information gathered from the malicious script to a remote endpoint.::STEP:4:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Get victim to click URL] In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to access the malicious URL.:TECHNIQUE:Send a phishing email to the victim containing the malicious URL. This can be hidden in a hyperlink as to not show the full URL, which might draw suspicion.:TECHNIQUE:Put the malicious URL on a public forum, where many victims might accidentally click the link.::","::The targeted web application does not fully normalize input before checking for prohibited syntax. In particular, it must fail to recognize prohibited methods preceded by certain sequences of repeated characters.::",,::The adversary must trick the victim into following a crafted link to a vulnerable server or view a web post where the dangerous commands are executed.::,,,"::Design: Use libraries and templates that minimize unfiltered input.::Implementation: Normalize, filter and sanitize all user supplied fields.::Implementation: The victim should configure the browser to minimize active content from untrusted sources.::",,::85::,,
