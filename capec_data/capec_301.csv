301,TCP Connect Scan,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary uses full TCP connection attempts to determine if a port is open on the target system. The scanning process involves completing a 'three-way handshake' with a remote port, and reports the port as closed if the full handshake cannot be established. An advantage of TCP connect scanning is that it works against any TCP/IP stack.",,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:300::,::STEP:1:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:An adversary attempts to initialize a TCP connection with with the target port.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:An adversary uses the result of their TCP connection to determine the state of the target port. A successful connection indicates a port is open with a service listening on it while a failed connection indicates the port is not open.::,::The adversary requires logical access to the target network. The TCP connect Scan requires the ability to connect to an available port and complete a 'three-way-handshake' This scanning technique does not require any special privileges in order to perform. This type of scan works against all TCP/IP stack implementations.::,,"::The adversary can leverage a network mapper or scanner, or perform this attack via routine socket programming in a scripting language. Packet injection tools are also useful for this purpose. Depending upon the method used it may be necessary to sniff the network to see the response.::",,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::,::Employ a robust network defense posture that includes an IDS/IPS system.::,,::200::,,
