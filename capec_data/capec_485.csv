485,Signature Spoofing by Key Recreation,Detailed,Draft,An attacker obtains an authoritative or reputable signer's private signature key by exploiting a cryptographic weakness in the signature algorithm or pseudorandom number generation and then uses this key to forge signatures from the original signer to mislead a victim into performing actions that benefit the attacker.,,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:473::,,::An authoritative signer is using a weak method of random number generation or weak signing software that causes key leakage or permits key inference.::An authoritative signer is using a signature algorithm with a direct weakness or with poorly chosen parameters that enable the key to be recovered using signatures from that signer.::,::SKILL:Cryptanalysis of signature generation algorithm:LEVEL:High::SKILL:Reverse engineering and cryptanalysis of signature generation algorithm implementation and random number generation:LEVEL:High::SKILL:Ability to create malformed data blobs and know how to present them directly or indirectly to a victim.:LEVEL:High::,,,,::Ensure cryptographic elements have been sufficiently tested for weaknesses.::,,::330::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1552.004:ENTRY NAME:Unsecure Credentials: Private Keys::,,
