234,Hijacking a privileged process,Standard,Draft,"An adversary gains control of a process that is assigned elevated privileges in order to execute arbitrary code with those privileges. Some processes are assigned elevated privileges on an operating system, usually through association with a particular user, group, or role. If an attacker can hijack this process, they will be able to assume its level of privilege in order to execute their own code.",,,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:233::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:100::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:175::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:242::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Find process with elevated priveleges] The adversary probes for processes running with elevated privileges.:TECHNIQUE:On Windows, use the process explorer's security tab to see if a process is running with administror privileges.:TECHNIQUE:On Linux, use the ps command to view running processes and pipe the output to a search for a particular user, or the root user.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Find vulnerability in running process] The adversary looks for a vulnerability in the running process that would allow for arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the running process.:TECHNIQUE:Look for improper input validation:TECHNIQUE:Look for a buffer overflow which may be exploited if an adversary can inject unvalidated data.:TECHNIQUE:Utilize system utilities that support process control that have been inadequately secured::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Execute arbitrary code] The adversary exploits the vulnerability that they have found and hijacks the running process.::",::The targeted process or operating system must contain a bug that allows attackers to hijack the targeted process.::,,::None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack.::,,,,,::732::648::,,
