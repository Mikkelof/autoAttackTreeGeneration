443,Malicious Logic Inserted Into Product by Authorized Developer,Detailed,Stable,An adversary uses their privileged position within an authorized development organization to inject malicious logic into a codebase or product.,,Medium,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:444::,,::Access to the product during the initial or continuous development.::,,,,::SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::,"::Assess software and hardware during development and prior to deployment to ensure that it functions as intended and without any malicious functionality. This includes both initial development, as well as updates propagated to the product after deployment.::","::In January 2022 the author of popular JavaScript packages Faker and colors, used for generating mock data and including colored text within NodeJS consoles respectively, introduced malicious code that resulted in a Denial of Service (DoS) via an infinite loop. When applications that leveraged these packages updated to the malicious version, their applications executed the infinite loop and output gibberish ASCI characters endlessly. This resulted in the application being unusable until a stable version of the package was obtained. [REF-705]::During initial development, an authorized hardware developer implants a malicious microcontroller within an Internet of Things (IOT) device and programs the microcontroller to communicate with the vulnerable device. Each time the device initializes, the malicious microcontroller's code is executed, which ultimately provides the adversary with backdoor access to the vulnerable device. This can further allow the adversary to sniff network traffic, exfiltrate date, execute unauthorized commands, and/or pivot to other vulnerable devices.::",,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.002:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.003:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain::,
