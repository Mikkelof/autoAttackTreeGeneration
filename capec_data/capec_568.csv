568,Capture Credentials via Keylogger,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary deploys a keylogger in an effort to obtain credentials directly from a system's user. After capturing all the keystrokes made by a user, the adversary can analyze the data and determine which string are likely to be passwords or other credential related information.",,,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:569::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:270::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:151::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:560::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:561::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:600::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:653::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine which user's credentials to capture] Since this is a more targeted attack, an adversary will first identify a particular user they wish the capture the credentials of.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Deploy keylogger] Once a user is identified, an adversary will deploy a keylogger to the user's system in one of many ways.:TECHNIQUE:Send a phishing email with a malicious attachment that installs a keylogger on a user's system:TECHNIQUE:Conceal a keylogger behind fake software and get the user to download the software:TECHNIQUE:Get a user to click on a malicious URL that directs them to a webpage that will install a keylogger without their knowledge:TECHNIQUE:Gain access to the user's system through a vulnerability and manually install a keylogger::STEP:3:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Record keystrokes] Once the keylogger is deployed on the user's system, the adversary will record keystrokes over a period of time.::STEP:4:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Analyze data and determine credentials] Using the captured keystrokes, the adversary will be able to determine the credentials of the user.:TECHNIQUE:Search for repeated sequences that are following by the enter key:TECHNIQUE:Search for repeated sequences that are not found in a dictionary:TECHNIQUE:Search for several backspaces in a row. This could indicate a mistyped password. The correct password can then be inferred using the whole key sequence::STEP:5:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Use found credentials] After the adversary has found the credentials for the target user, they will then use them to gain access to a system in order to perform some follow-up attack::","::The ability to install the keylogger, either in person or remote.::",,,,,::Strong physical security can help reduce the ability of an adversary to install a keylogger.::,,,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1056.001:ENTRY NAME:Input Capture:Keylogging::,
