492,Regular Expression Exponential Blowup,Standard,Draft,An adversary may execute an attack on a program that uses a poor Regular Expression(Regex) implementation by choosing input that results in an extreme situation for the Regex. A typical extreme situation operates at exponential time compared to the input size. This is due to most implementations using a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton(NFA) state machine to be built by the Regex algorithm since NFA allows backtracking and thus more complex regular expressions.,,,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:130::,,"::This type of an attack requires the ability to identify hosts running a poorly implemented Regex, and the ability to send crafted input to exploit the regular expression.::",,,,,::Test custom written Regex with fuzzing to determine if the Regex is a poor one. Add timeouts to processes that handle the Regex logic. If an evil Regex is found rewrite it as a good Regex.::,,::400::1333::,TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Attacks:ENTRY NAME:Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS::,,
