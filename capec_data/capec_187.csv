187,Malicious Automated Software Update via Redirection,Detailed,Draft,"An attacker exploits two layers of weaknesses in server or client software for automated update mechanisms to undermine the integrity of the target code-base. The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content. This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated, allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship. The second weakness is a systemic failure to validate the identity and integrity of code downloaded from a remote location, hence the inability to distinguish malicious code from a legitimate update.",,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:186::,,,,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::,,,::494::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1072:ENTRY NAME:Software Deployment Tools::,,
