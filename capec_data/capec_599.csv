599,Terrestrial Jamming,Detailed,Draft,"In this attack pattern, the adversary transmits disruptive signals in the direction of the target's consumer-level satellite dish (as opposed to the satellite itself). The transmission disruption occurs in a more targeted range. Portable terrestrial jammers have a range of 3-5 kilometers in urban areas and 20 kilometers in rural areas. This technique requires a terrestrial jammer that is more powerful than the frequencies sent from the satellite.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:195::,,,,::A terrestrial satellite jammer with a signal more powerful than that of the satellite attempting to communicate with the target. The adversary must know the location of the target satellite dish.::,,"::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:A successful attack will deny, degrade, or disrupt availability of satellite communications for the target by overwhelming its resources to accurately receive authorized transmissions.::",,"::An attempt to deceive a GPS receiver by broadcasting counterfeit GPS signals, structured to resemble a set of normal GPS signals. These jamming signals may be structured in such a way as to cause the receiver to estimate its position to be somewhere other than where it actually is, or to be located where it is but at a different time, as determined by the adversary.::",,,
