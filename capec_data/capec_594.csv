594,Traffic Injection,Meta,Stable,"An adversary injects traffic into the target's network connection. The adversary is therefore able to degrade or disrupt the connection, and potentially modify the content. This is not a flooding attack, as the adversary is not focusing on exhausting resources. Instead, the adversary is crafting a specific input to affect the system in a particular way.",,,,,,"::The target application must leverage an open communications channel.::The channel on which the target communicates must be vulnerable to interception (e.g., adversary in the middle attack - CAPEC-94).::",,"::A tool, such as a MITM Proxy, that is capable of generating and injecting custom inputs to be used in the attack.::",,"::SCOPE:Availability:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Unreliable Execution:NOTE:The injection of specific content into a connection can trigger a disruption in that communications channel, thereby denying availability of the service.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:An adversary's injection of additional content into a communication channel negatively impacts the integrity of that channel.::",,,::940::,,,
