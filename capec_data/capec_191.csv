191,Read Sensitive Constants Within an Executable,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary engages in activities to discover any sensitive constants present within the compiled code of an executable. These constants may include literal ASCII strings within the file itself, or possibly strings hard-coded into particular routines that can be revealed by code refactoring methods including static and dynamic analysis.",,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:167::,,::Access to a binary or executable such that it can be analyzed by various utilities.::,,"::Binary analysis programs such as 'strings' or 'grep', or hex editors.::",,,,,::798::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1552.001:ENTRY NAME:Unsecured Credentials:Credentials in files::,"TYPE:Other:NOTE:More sophisticated methods of searching for sensitive strings within a file involve disassembly or decompiling of the file. One could, for example, utilize disassembly methods on an ISAPI executable or dll to discover a hard-coded password within the code as it executes. This type of analysis usually involves four stages in which first a debugger is attached to the running process, anti-debugging countermeasures are circumvented or bypassed, the program is analyzed step-by-step, and breakpoints are established so that discrete functions and data structures can be analyzed. Debugging tools such as SoftICE, Ollydbg, or vendor supplied debugging tools are often used. Disassembly tools such as IDA pro, or similar tools, can also be employed. A third strategy for accessing sensitive strings within a binary involves the decompilation of the file itself into source code that reveals the strings. An example of this type of analysis involves extracting source code from a java JAR file and then using functionality within a java IDE to search the source code for sensitive, hard-coded information. In performing this analysis native java tools, such as jar are used to extract the compiled class files. Next, a java decompiler such as DJ is used to extract java source code from the compiled classes, revealing source code. Finally, the source code is audited to reveal sensitive information, a step that is usually assisted by source code analysis programs.::",
