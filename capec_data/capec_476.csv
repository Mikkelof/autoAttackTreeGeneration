476,Signature Spoofing by Misrepresentation,Detailed,Draft,"An attacker exploits a weakness in the parsing or display code of the recipient software to generate a data blob containing a supposedly valid signature, but the signer's identity is falsely represented, which can lead to the attacker manipulating the recipient software or its victim user to perform compromising actions.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:473::,,"::Recipient is using signature verification software that does not clearly indicate potential homographs in the signer identity.Recipient is using signature verification software that contains a parsing vulnerability, or allows control characters in the signer identity field, such that a signature is mistakenly displayed as valid and from a known or authoritative signer.::","::SKILL:Attacker needs to understand the layout and composition of data blobs used by the target application.:LEVEL:High::SKILL:To discover a specific vulnerability, attacker needs to reverse engineer signature parsing, signature verification and signer representation code.:LEVEL:High::SKILL:Attacker may be required to create malformed data blobs and know how to insert them in a location that the recipient will visit.:LEVEL:High::",,,,"::Ensure the application is using parsing and data display techniques that will accurately display control characters, international symbols and markings, and ultimately recognize potential homograph attacks.::",,::290::,,,
