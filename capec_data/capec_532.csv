The malicious BIOS is put in place on the manufacturer's website, the victim location is sent an official-looking email informing the victim of the availability of a new BIOS with bug fixes and enhanced performance capabilities to entice the victim to install the new BIOS quickly. The malicious BIOS is downloaded and installed on the victim's system, which allows for additional compromise by the attacker.::",,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1495:ENTRY NAME:Firmware Corruption::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1542.001:ENTRY NAME:Pre-OS Boot:System Firmware::,,
