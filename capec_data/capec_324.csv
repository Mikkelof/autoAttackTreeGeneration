324,TCP (ISN) Sequence Predictability Probe,Detailed,Stable,"This type of operating system probe attempts to determine an estimate for how predictable the sequence number generation algorithm is for a remote host. Statistical techniques, such as standard deviation, can be used to determine how predictable the sequence number generation is for a system. This result can then be compared to a database of operating system behaviors to determine a likely match for operating system and version.",,Medium,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:312::,,"::The ability to monitor and interact with network communications.Access to at least one host, and the privileges to interface with the network interface card.::",,::A tool capable of sending and receiving packets from a remote system.::,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities::,,,::200::,,
