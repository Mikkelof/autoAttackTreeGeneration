However it is possible to cause a crash resulting in arbitrary code execution, leading to a jump from the data plane to the control plane [REF-89].::::TYPE:Other:NOTE:The main weakness in serialized data related DoS is that the service provider generally must inspect, parse, and validate the data messages to determine routing, workflow, security considerations, and so on. It is exactly these inspection, parsing, and validation routines that DoS targets.::"
