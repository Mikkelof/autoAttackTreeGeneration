32,XSS Through HTTP Query Strings,Detailed,Draft,An adversary embeds malicious script code in the parameters of an HTTP query string and convinces a victim to submit the HTTP request that contains the query string to a vulnerable web application. The web application then procedes to use the values parameters without properly validation them first and generates the HTML code that will be executed by the victim's browser.,,High,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:591::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:588::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:592::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Survey the application for public links] Using a browser or an automated tool, an adversary follows all public links on a web site. They record all the links they find.:TECHNIQUE:Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links. Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL.:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application. Make special note of any links that include parameters in the URL. Manual traversal of this type is frequently necessary to identify forms that are GET method forms rather than POST forms.:TECHNIQUE:Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browser's plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the URL discovery.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Probe public links for XSS vulnerability] The adversary uses the public links gathered in the Explore phase as a target list and requests variations on the URLs they spidered before. They send parameters that include variations of payloads. They record all the responses from the server that include unmodified versions of their script.:TECHNIQUE:Use a list of XSS probe strings to inject in parameters of known URLs. If possible, the probe strings contain a unique identifier.:TECHNIQUE:Use a proxy tool to record results of manual input of XSS probes in known URLs.::STEP:3:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Craft malicious XSS URL] Once the adversary has determined which parameters are vulnerable to XSS, they will craft a malicious URL containing the XSS exploit. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from the victim.:TECHNIQUE:Change a URL parameter to include a malicious script tag.:TECHNIQUE:Send information gathered from the malicious script to a remote endpoint.::STEP:4:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Get victim to click URL] In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to access the malicious URL.:TECHNIQUE:Send a phishing email to the victim containing the malicious URL. This can be hidden in a hyperlink as to not show the full URL, which might draw suspicion.:TECHNIQUE:Put the malicious URL on a public forum, where many victims might accidentally click the link.::",::Target client software must allow scripting such as JavaScript.

This can be done manually via web browser or trivially scripted to post the query string to multiple sites. In the latter case, in the instance of many sites using similar infrastructure with predictable http queries being accepted and operated on (such as blogging software, Google applications, and so on), a single malicious payload can be scripted to target a wide variety of sites. Web 2.0 type sites like Technorati and del.icio.us rely on user generated content like tags to build http links that are displayed to other users. del.icio.us allows users to identify sites, tag them with metadata and provide URL, descriptions and more data. This data is then echoed back to any other web browser that is interested in the link. If the data is not validated by the del.icio.us site properly then an arbitrary code can be added into the standard http string sent to del.icio.us by the adversary, for example formatted as normal content with a URL and description and tagged as Java, and available to be clicked on (and executed by) any user browsing for Java content that clicks on this trojaned content.::",::80::,,,
