608,Cryptanalysis of Cellular Encryption,Detailed,Draft,"The use of cryptanalytic techniques to derive cryptographic keys or otherwise effectively defeat cellular encryption to reveal traffic content. Some cellular encryption algorithms such as A5/1 and A5/2 (specified for GSM use) are known to be vulnerable to such attacks and commercial tools are available to execute these attacks and decrypt mobile phone conversations in real-time. Newer encryption algorithms in use by UMTS and LTE are stronger and currently believed to be less vulnerable to these types of attacks. Note, however, that an attacker with a Cellular Rogue Base Station can force the use of weak cellular encryption even by newer mobile devices.",,,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:97::,,::None::,::SKILL:Adversaries can rent commercial supercomputer time globally to conduct cryptanalysis on encrypted data captured from mobile devices.
