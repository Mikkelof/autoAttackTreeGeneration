537,Infiltration of Hardware Development Environment,Detailed,Draft,"An adversary, leveraging the ability to manipulate components of primary support systems and tools within the development and production environments, inserts malicious software within the hardware and/or firmware development environment. The infiltration purpose is to alter developed hardware components in a system destined for deployment at the victim's organization, for the purpose of disruption or further compromise.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:444::,,::The victim must use email or removable media from systems running the IDE (or systems adjacent to the IDE systems).::The victim must have a system running exploitable applications and/or a vulnerable configuration to allow for initial infiltration.::The adversary must have working knowledge of some if not all of the components involved in the IDE system as well as the infrastructure.::,"::SKILL:Intelligence about the manufacturer's operating environment and infrastructure.:LEVEL:Medium::SKILL:Ability to develop, deploy, and maintain a stealth malicious backdoor program remotely in what is essentially a hostile environment.:LEVEL:High::SKILL:Development skills to construct malicious attachments that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in typical desktop applications or system configurations. The malicious attachments should be crafted well enough to bypass typical defensive systems (IDS, anti-virus, etc):LEVEL:High::",,,,"::Verify software downloads and updates to ensure they have not been modified be adversaries::Leverage antivirus tools to detect known malware::Do not download software from untrusted sources::Educate designers, developers, engineers, etc. on social engineering attacks to avoid downloading malicious software via attacks such as phishing attacks::","::The adversary, knowing the manufacturer runs email on a system adjacent to the hardware development systems used for hardware and/or firmware design, sends a phishing email with a malicious attachment to the manufacturer. When viewed, the malicious attachment installs a backdoor that allows the adversary to remotely compromise the adjacent hardware development system from the manufacturer's workstation. The adversary is then able to exfiltrate and alter sensitive data on the hardware system, allowing for future compromise once the developed system is deployed at the victim location.::",,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.003:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain::,
