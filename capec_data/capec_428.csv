428,Influence via Modes of Thinking,Detailed,Draft,"The adversary tailors their communication to the language and thought patterns of the target thereby weakening barriers or reluctance to communication. This method is a way of building rapport with a target by matching their speech patterns and the primary ways or dominant senses with which they make abstractions. This technique can be used to make the target more receptive to sharing information because the adversary has adapted their communication forms to match those of the target. When skillfully employed, the target is likely to be unaware that they are being manipulated.",,,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:427::,,,,,,,,,,,
