672,Malicious Code Implanted During Chip Programming,Detailed,Draft,"During the programming step of chip manufacture, an adversary with access and necessary technical skills maliciously alters a chip’s intended program logic to produce an effect intended by the adversary when the fully manufactured chip is deployed and in operational use. Intended effects can include the ability of the adversary to remotely control a host system to carry out malicious acts.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:444::,,"::An adversary would need to have access to a foundry’s or chip maker’s development/production environment where programs for specific chips are developed, managed and uploaded into targeted chips prior to distribution or sale.::","::SKILL:An adversary needs to be skilled in microprogramming, manipulation of configuration management systems, and in the operation of tools used for the uploading of programs into chips during manufacture. Uploading can be for individual chips or performed on a large scale basis.:LEVEL:Medium::",,,::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,"::Utilize DMEA’s (Defense Microelectronics Activity) Trusted Foundry Program members for acquisition of microelectronic components.::Ensure that each supplier performing hardware development implements comprehensive, security-focused configuration management of microcode and microcode generating tools and software.::Require that provenance of COTS microelectronic components be known whenever procured.::Conduct detailed vendor assessment before acquiring COTS hardware.::","::Following a chip’s production process steps of test and verification and validation of chip circuitry, an adversary involved in the generation of microcode defining the chip’s function(s) inserts a malicious instruction that will become part of the chip’s program. When integrated into a system, the chip will produce an effect intended by the adversary.::",,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.003:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain::,
