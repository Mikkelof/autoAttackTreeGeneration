531,Hardware Component Substitution,Detailed,Draft,"An attacker substitutes out a tested and approved hardware component for a maliciously-altered hardware component. This type of attack is carried out directly on the system, enabling the attacker to then cause disruption or additional compromise.",,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:534::,,::Physical access to the system or the integration facility where hardware components are kept.::,::SKILL:Able to develop and manufacture malicious system components that perform the same functions and processes as their non-malicious counterparts.:LEVEL:High::,,,,,"::An attacker has access to an organization's warehouse of card readers being included as a part of an overall security system. By replacing a critical hardware component in the card reader, the attacker is able to alter the function of the card reader to allow an attacker-supplied card to bypass a security checkpoint. The card reader is placed in the warehouse, and later used in the victim's security system. The attacker is then able to go to the victim and use their own card and bypass a physical security checkpoint and gain access to the victim's location for further malicious activity.::",,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.003:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain::,,
