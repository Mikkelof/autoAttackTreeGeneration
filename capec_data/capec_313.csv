313,Passive OS Fingerprinting,Standard,Stable,"An adversary engages in activity to detect the version or type of OS software in a an environment by passively monitoring communication between devices, nodes, or applications. Passive techniques for operating system detection send no actual probes to a target, but monitor network or client-server communication between nodes in order to identify operating systems based on observed behavior as compared to a database of known signatures or values. While passive OS fingerprinting is not usually as reliable as active methods, it is generally better able to evade detection.",,High,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:224::,,"::The ability to monitor network communications.Access to at least one host, and the privileges to interface with the network interface card.::",,"::Any tool capable of monitoring network communications, like a packet sniffer (e.g., Wireshark)::",,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities::,,,::200::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1082:ENTRY NAME:System Information Discovery::,,
