669,Alteration of a Software Update,Standard,Draft,"An adversary with access to an organization’s software update infrastructure inserts malware into the content of an outgoing update to fielded systems where a wide range of malicious effects are possible. With the same level of access, the adversary can alter a software update to perform specific malicious acts including granting the adversary control over the software’s normal functionality.",,Medium,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:184::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:670::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:673::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Identify software with frequent updates] The adversary must first identify a target software that has updates at least with some frequency, enough that there is am update infrastructure.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Gain access to udpate infrastructure] The adversary must then gain access to the organization's software update infrastructure. This can either be done by gaining remote access from outside the organization, or by having a malicious actor inside the organization gain access. It is often easier if someone within the organization gains access.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Alter the software update] Through access to the software update infrastructure, an adversary will alter the software update by injecting malware into the content of an outgoing update.::",::An adversary would need to have penetrated an organization’s software update infrastructure including gaining access to components supporting the configuration management of software versions and updates related to the software maintenance of customer systems.::,"::SKILL:Skills required include the ability to infiltrate the organization’s software update infrastructure either from the Internet or from within the organization, including subcontractors, and be able to change software being delivered to customer/user systems in an undetected manner.:LEVEL:High::",,,::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges::SCOPE:Authorization:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Data::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::,"::Have a Software Assurance Plan that includes maintaining strict configuration management control of source code, object code and software development, build and distribution tools; manual code reviews and static code analysis for developmental software; and tracking of all storage and movement of code.::Require elevated privileges for distribution of software and software updates.::",::A subcontractor to a software developer injects maliciously altered software updates into an automated update process that distributes to government and commercial customers software containing a hidden backdoor.::,,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.002:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain::,
