444,Development Alteration,Standard,Stable,"An adversary modifies a technology, product, or component during its development to acheive a negative impact once the system is deployed. The goal of the adversary is to modify the system in such a way that the negative impact can be leveraged when the system is later deployed. Development alteration attacks may include attacks that insert malicious logic into the system's software, modify or replace hardware components, and other attacks which negatively impact the system during development. These attacks generally require insider access to modify source code or to tamper with hardware components. The product is then delivered to the user where the negative impact can be leveraged at a later time.",,Medium,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:438::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:206::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:443::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:445::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:446::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:511::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:516::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:520::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:532::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:537::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:538::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:539::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:670::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:672::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:673::NATURE:ParentOf:CAPEC ID:678::NATURE:CanFollow:CAPEC ID:691::,,::Access to the system during the development phase to alter and/or modify software and hardware components.
