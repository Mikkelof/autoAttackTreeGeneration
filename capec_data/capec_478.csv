478,Modification of Windows Service Configuration,Detailed,Usable,An adversary exploits a weakness in access control to modify the execution parameters of a Windows service. The goal of this attack is to execute a malicious binary in place of an existing service.,,Low,High,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:203::,"::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Determine target system] The adversary must first determine the system they wish to modify the registry of. This needs to be a windows machine as this attack only works on the windows registry.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Gain access to the system] The adversary needs to gain access to the system in some way so that they can modify the windows registry.:TECHNIQUE:Gain physical access to a system either through shoulder surfing a password or accessing a system that is left unlocked.:TECHNIQUE:Gain remote access to a system through a variety of means.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Modify windows registry] The adversary will modify the windows registry by changing the configuration settings for a service. Specifically, the adversary will change the path settings to define a path to a malicious binary to be executed.::",::The adversary must have the capability to write to the Windows Registry on the targeted system.::,,::None: No specialized resources are required to execute this type of attack.::,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands:NOTE:By altering specific configuration settings for the service, the adversary could run arbitrary code to be executed.::",::Ensure proper permissions are set for Registry hives to prevent users from modifying keys for system components that may lead to privilege escalation.::,,::284::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1574.011:ENTRY NAME:Hijack Execution Flow:Service Registry Permissions Weakness::::TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1543.003:ENTRY NAME:Create or Modify System Process:Windows Service::,,
