An adversary then modifies this memory to either bypass the secure boot process or to execute their own code.::A hardware product leverages a CPU that does not possess a memory-protection unit (MPU) and a memory-management unit (MMU) nor a special bit to support write exclusivity, resulting in no write exclusivity. Because of this, an adversary is able to inject malicious code into the memory and later execute it to achieve the desired outcome.::",::1222::1252::1257::1260::1274::1282::1312::1316::1326::,,,
