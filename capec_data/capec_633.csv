633,Token Impersonation,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary exploits a weakness in authentication to create an access token (or equivalent) that impersonates a different entity, and then associates a process/thread to that that impersonated token. This action causes a downstream user to make a decision or take action that is based on the assumed identity, and not the response that blocks the adversary.",,,Medium,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:194::,,"::This pattern of attack is only applicable when a downstream user leverages tokens to verify identity, and then takes action based on that identity.::",,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:NOTE:By faking the source of data or services, an adversary can cause a target to make incorrect decisions about how to proceed.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges:NOTE:By impersonating identities that have an increased level of access, an adversary gain privilege that they many not have otherwise had.::SCOPE:Integrity:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Hide Activities:NOTE:Faking the source of data or services can be used to create a false trail in logs as the target will associated any actions with the impersonated identity instead of the adversary.::",,,::287::1270::,TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1134:ENTRY NAME:Access Token Manipulation::,,
