To increase the attack space, this will often be popular software with a large user-base.::STEP:2:PHASE:Experiment:DESCRIPTION:[Create malicious extension] Having identified a suitable target, the adversary crafts a malicious extension/plugin that can be installed by the underlying target software. This malware may be targeted to execute on specific operating systems or be operating system agnostic.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Install malicious extension] The malicious extension/plugin is installed by the underlying target software and executes the adversary-created malware, resulting in a variety of negative technical impacts.:TECHNIQUE:Adversary-Installed: Having already compromised the target system, the adversary simply installs the malicious extension/plugin themself.:TECHNIQUE:User-Installed: The adversary tricks the user into installing the malicious extension/plugin, via means such as social engineering, or may upload the malware on a reputable extension/plugin hosting site and wait for unknowing victims to install the malicious component.::","::The adversary must craft malware based on the type of software and system(s) they intend to exploit.::If the adversary intends to install the malicious extension themself, they must first compromise the target machine via some other means.::",::SKILL:Ability to create malicious extensions that can exploit specific software applications and systems.:LEVEL:Medium::SKILL:Optional: Ability to exploit target system(s) via other means in order to gain entry.:LEVEL:Medium::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Modify Data::SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Commands:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges::,"::Only install extensions/plugins from official/verifiable sources.::Confirm extensions/plugins are legitimate and not malware masquerading as a legitimate extension/plugin.::Ensure the underlying software leveraging the extension/plugin (including operating systems) is up-to-date.::Implement an extension/plugin allow list, based on the given security policy.::If applicable, confirm extensions/plugins are properly signed by the official developers.::For web browsers, close sessions when finished to prevent malicious extensions/plugins from executing the the background.::","::In January 2018, Palo Alto's Unit 42 reported that a malicious Internet Information Services (IIS) extension they named RGDoor was used to create a backdoor into several Middle Eastern government organizations, as well as a financial institution and an educational institution. This malware was used in conjunction with the TwoFace webshell and allowed the adversaries to upload/download files and execute unauthorized commands. [REF-740]::In December 2018, it was reported that North Korea-based APT Kimusky (also known as Velvet Chollima) infected numerous legitimate academic organizations within the U.S., many specializing in biomedical engineering, with a malicious Google Chrome extension. Dubbed Operation STOLEN PENCIL, the attack entailed conducting spear-phishing attacks to trick victims into installing a malicious PDF reader named Auto Font Manager. Once installed, the malware allowed adversaries to steal cookies and site passwords, as well as forward emails from some compromised accounts.
