285,ICMP Echo Request Ping,Detailed,Stable,"An adversary sends out an ICMP Type 8 Echo Request, commonly known as a 'Ping', in order to determine if a target system is responsive. If the request is not blocked by a firewall or ACL, the target host will respond with an ICMP Type 0 Echo Reply datagram. This type of exchange is usually referred to as a 'Ping' due to the Ping utility present in almost all operating systems. Ping, as commonly implemented, allows a user to test for alive hosts, measure round-trip time, and measure the percentage of packet loss.",,Medium,Low,::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:292::,,::The ability to send an ICMP type 8 query (Echo Request) to a remote target and receive an ICMP type 0 message (ICMP Echo Reply) in response. Any firewalls or access control lists between the sender and receiver must allow ICMP Type 8 and ICMP Type 0 messages in order for a ping operation to succeed.::,::SKILL:The adversary needs to know certain linux commands for this type of attack.:LEVEL:Low::,::Scanners or utilities that provide the ability to send custom ICMP queries.::,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:A successful attack of this kind can identify open ports and available services on a system.::,"::Consider configuring firewall rules to block ICMP Echo requests and prevent replies. If not practical, monitor and consider action when a system has fast and a repeated pattern of requests that move incrementally through port numbers.::",,::200::,,
