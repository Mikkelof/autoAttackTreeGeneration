572,Call to Thread run() instead of start(),Variant,Draft,"The product calls a thread's run() method instead of calling start(), which causes the code to run in the thread of the caller instead of the callee.","In most cases a direct call to a Thread object's run() method is a bug. The programmer intended to begin a new thread of control, but accidentally called run() instead of start(), so the run() method will execute in the caller's thread of control.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:821:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use the start() method instead of the run() method.::,,,::System Process::,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:THI00-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not invoke Thread.run()::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP3:ENTRY NAME:Use of an improper API::,,,
