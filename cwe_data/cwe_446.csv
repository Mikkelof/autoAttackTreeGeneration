446,UI Discrepancy for Security Feature,Class,Incomplete,"The user interface does not correctly enable or configure a security feature, but the interface provides feedback that causes the user to believe that the feature is in a secure state.","When the user interface does not properly reflect what the user asks of it, then it can lead the user into a false sense of security. For example, the user might check a box to enable a security option to enable encrypted communications, but the product does not actually enable the encryption. Alternately, the user might provide a restrict ALL access control rule, but the product only implements restrict SOME.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:684:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,,::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-1446:DESCRIPTION:UI inconsistency; visited URLs list not cleared when Clear History option is selected.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1446::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:User interface inconsistency::,,::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is likely a loose composite that could be broken down into the different types of errors that cause the user interface to have incorrect interactions with the underlying security feature.::,
