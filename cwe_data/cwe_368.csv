368,Context Switching Race Condition,Base,Draft,"A product performs a series of non-atomic actions to switch between contexts that cross privilege or other security boundaries, but a race condition allows an attacker to modify or misrepresent the product's behavior during the switch.","This is commonly seen in web browser vulnerabilities in which the attacker can perform certain actions while the browser is transitioning from a trusted to an untrusted domain, or vice versa, and the browser performs the actions on one domain using the trust level and resources of the other domain.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:362:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:364:VIEW ID:1000::,"::ORDINALITY:Primary:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be primary to almost anything, depending on the context of the race condition.::ORDINALITY:Resultant:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be resultant from insufficient compartmentalization (CWE-653), incorrect locking, improper initialization or shutdown, or a number of other weaknesses.::",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-1837:DESCRIPTION:Chain: race condition (CWE-362) from improper handling of a page transition in web client while an applet is loading (CWE-368) leads to use after free (CWE-416):LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1837::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2260:DESCRIPTION:Browser updates address bar as soon as user clicks on a link instead of when the page has loaded, allowing spoofing by redirecting to another page using onUnload method. ** this is one example of the role of hooks and context switches, and should be captured somehow - also a race condition of sorts **:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2260::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0191:DESCRIPTION:XSS when web browser executes Javascript events in the context of a new page while it's being loaded, allowing interaction with previous page in different domain.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0191::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2491:DESCRIPTION:Web browser fills in address bar of clicked-on link before page has been loaded, and doesn't update afterward.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2491::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Context Switching Race Condition::,::26::29::,::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Can overlap signal handler race conditions.::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-studied as a concept.
