622,Improper Validation of Function Hook Arguments,Variant,Draft,"The product adds hooks to user-accessible API functions, but it does not properly validate the arguments. This could lead to resultant vulnerabilities.","Such hooks can be used in defensive software that runs with privileges, such as anti-virus or firewall, which hooks kernel calls. When the arguments are not validated, they could be used to bypass the protection scheme or attack the product itself.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:20:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Unexpected State::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all arguments are verified, as defined by the API you are protecting.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Drop privileges before invoking such functions, if possible.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-0708:DESCRIPTION:DoS in firewall using standard Microsoft functions:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0708::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-7160:DESCRIPTION:DoS in firewall using standard Microsoft functions:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-7160::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-1376:DESCRIPTION:function does not verify that its argument is the proper type, leading to arbitrary memory write:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1376::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-1220:DESCRIPTION:invalid syscall arguments bypass code execution limits:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1220::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-4541:DESCRIPTION:DoS in IDS via NULL argument:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-4541::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP27:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to environment::,,,
