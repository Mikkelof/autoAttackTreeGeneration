693,Protection Mechanism Failure,Pillar,Draft,The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.,"This weakness covers three distinct situations. A missing protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An insufficient protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an ignored mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.",,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,,,,,,,::1::107::127::17::20::22::237::36::477::480::51::57::59::65::668::74::87::,"::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.::",
