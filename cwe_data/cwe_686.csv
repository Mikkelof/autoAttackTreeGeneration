686,Function Call With Incorrect Argument Type,Variant,Draft,"The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies an argument that is the wrong data type, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.","This weakness is most likely to occur in loosely typed languages, or in strongly typed languages in which the types of variable arguments cannot be enforced at compilation time, or where there is implicit casting.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:628:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation::,,::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected argument type.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:EXP37-C:ENTRY NAME:Call functions with the correct number and type of arguments:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FIO47-C:ENTRY NAME:Use valid format strings:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:POS34-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not call putenv() with a pointer to an automatic variable as the argument::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:STR37-C:ENTRY NAME:Arguments to character handling functions must be representable as an unsigned char::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::,,,
