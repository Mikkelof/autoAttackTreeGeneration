922,Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information,Class,Incomplete,The product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.,"If read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information. If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:664:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:System Configuration::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:NOTE:Attackers can read sensitive information by accessing the unrestricted storage mechanism.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories:NOTE:Attackers can overwrite sensitive information by accessing the unrestricted storage mechanism.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-2272:DESCRIPTION:password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2272::,,,,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data. While data tampering would be visible upon inspection, the integrity and availability of the data is compromised prior to the audit.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This is a high-level entry that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view (CWE-1000). Currently, most of the information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.::",
