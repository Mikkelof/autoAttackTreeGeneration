1253,Incorrect Selection of Fuse Values,Base,Draft,The logic level used to set a system to a secure state relies on a fuse being unblown. An attacker can set the system to an insecure state merely by blowing the fuse.,"Fuses are often used to store secret data, including security configuration data. When not blown, a fuse is considered to store a logic 0, and, when blown, it indicates a logic 1. Fuses are generally considered to be one-directional, i.e., once blown to logic 1, it cannot be reset to logic 0. However, if the logic used to determine system-security state (by leveraging the values sensed from the fuses) uses negative logic, an attacker might blow the fuse and drive the system to an insecure state.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:693:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Logic should be designed in a way that blown fuses do not put the product into an insecure state that can be leveraged by an attacker.::,,,,,::74::,::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.::,
