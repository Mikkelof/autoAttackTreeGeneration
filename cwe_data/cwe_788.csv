788,Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer,Base,Incomplete,The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.,This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is incremented to a position after the buffer; or when pointer arithmetic results in a position after the buffer.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:119:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:119:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:119:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory:NOTE:For an out-of-bounds read, the attacker may have access to sensitive information. If the sensitive information contains system details, such as the current buffer's position in memory, this knowledge can be used to craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code, as with a standard buffer overflow. If the attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can redirect a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an administrator.::","::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-2550:DESCRIPTION:Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2550::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-2403:DESCRIPTION:Heap-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2403::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-0689:DESCRIPTION:large precision value in a format string triggers overflow:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0689::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-0558:DESCRIPTION:attacker-controlled array index leads to code execution:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0558::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-4113:DESCRIPTION:OS kernel trusts userland-supplied length value, allowing reading of sensitive information:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4113::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-4268:DESCRIPTION:Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122):LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4268::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCRM:ENTRY ID:ASCRM-CWE-788::,,,
