923,Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints,Class,Incomplete,"The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.","Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint. While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:If an attacker can spoof the endpoint, the attacker gains all the privileges that were intended for the original endpoint.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30319:DESCRIPTION:S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30319::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-22547:DESCRIPTION:A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22547::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-4390:DESCRIPTION:A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4390::REFERENCE:CVE-2012-2292:DESCRIPTION:Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2292::REFERENCE:CVE-2012-5810:DESCRIPTION:Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-5810::REFERENCE:CVE-2014-1266:DESCRIPTION:chain: incorrect goto in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversry-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple goto fail bug).
