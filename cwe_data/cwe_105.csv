105,Struts: Form Field Without Validator,Variant,Draft,"The product has a form field that is not validated by a corresponding validation form, which can introduce other weaknesses related to insufficient input validation.","Omitting validation for even a single input field may give attackers the leeway they need to compromise the product. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1173:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:20:VIEW ID:700:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Some products use the same ActionForm for more than one purpose.
