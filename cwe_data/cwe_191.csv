191,Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound),Base,Draft,"The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.",This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:Integer underflow:DESCRIPTION:Integer underflow is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue. Integer underflow is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.::",::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Instability:NOTE:This weakness will generally lead to undefined behavior and therefore crashes. In the case of overflows involving loop index variables, the likelihood of infinite loops is also high.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also, if the wrap around results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0816:DESCRIPTION:Integer underflow in firewall via malformed packet.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0816::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1002:DESCRIPTION:Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1002::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-0199:DESCRIPTION:Long input causes incorrect length calculation.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-0199::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1891:DESCRIPTION:Malformed icon causes integer underflow in loop counter variable.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1891::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Integer underflow (wrap or wraparound)::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT30-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT32-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result in overflow:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::,,,
