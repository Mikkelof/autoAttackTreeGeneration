1072,Data Resource Access without Use of Connection Pooling,Base,Incomplete,The product accesses a data resource through a database without using a connection pooling capability.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly, as connection pools allow connections to be reused without the overhead and time consumption of opening and closing a new connection. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:405:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Performance::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCPEM:ENTRY ID:ASCPEM-PRF-13::,,,
