776,Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion'),Base,Draft,"The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.","If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:674:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:674:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:405:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:XML:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:XEE:DESCRIPTION:XEE is the acronym commonly used for XML Entity Expansion.::TERM:Billion Laughs Attack::TERM:XML Bomb:DESCRIPTION:While the XML Bomb term was used in the early years of knowledge of this issue, the XEE term seems to be more commonly used.::",::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):NOTE:If parsed, recursive entity references allow the attacker to expand data exponentially, quickly consuming all system resources.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
