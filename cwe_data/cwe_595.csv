595,Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents,Variant,Incomplete,"The product compares object references instead of the contents of the objects themselves, preventing it from detecting equivalent objects.","For example, in Java, comparing objects using == usually produces deceptive results, since the == operator compares object references rather than values; often, this means that using == for strings is actually comparing the strings' references, not their values.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1025:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:JavaScript:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:PHP:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:This weakness can lead to erroneous results that can cause unexpected application behaviors.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:In Java, use the equals() method to compare objects instead of the == operator. If using ==, it is important for performance reasons that your objects are created by a static factory, not by a constructor.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:EXP02-J:ENTRY NAME:Use the two-argument Arrays.equals() method to compare the contents of arrays::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:EXP02-J:ENTRY NAME:Use the two-argument Arrays.equals() method to compare the contents of arrays::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:EXP03-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not use the equality operators when comparing values of boxed primitives::,,,
