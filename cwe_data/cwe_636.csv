636,Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open'),Class,Draft,"When the product encounters an error condition or failure, its design requires it to fall back to a state that is less secure than other options that are available, such as selecting the weakest encryption algorithm or using the most permissive access control restrictions.","By entering a less secure state, the product inherits the weaknesses associated with that state, making it easier to compromise. At the least, it causes administrators to have a false sense of security. This weakness typically occurs as a result of wanting to fail functional to minimize administration and support costs, instead of failing safe.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:657:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:755:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:280:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,::TERM:Failing Open::,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:Intended access restrictions can be bypassed, which is often contradictory to what the product's administrator expects.::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Subdivide and allocate resources and components so that a failure in one part does not affect the entire product.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-5277:DESCRIPTION:The failure of connection attempts in a web browser resets DNS pin restrictions.
