14,Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers,Variant,Draft,"Sensitive memory is cleared according to the source code, but compiler optimizations leave the memory untouched when it is not read from again, aka dead store removal.","This compiler optimization error occurs when: Secret data are stored in memory. The secret data are scrubbed from memory by overwriting its contents. The source code is compiled using an optimizing compiler, which identifies and removes the function that overwrites the contents as a dead store because the memory is not used subsequently.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:733:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Build and Compilation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:This weakness will allow data that has not been cleared from memory to be read. If this data contains sensitive password information, then an attacker can read the password and use the information to bypass protection mechanisms.::","::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:This specific weakness is impossible to detect using black box methods. While an analyst could examine memory to see that it has not been scrubbed, an analysis of the executable would not be successful. This is because the compiler has already removed the relevant code. Only the source code shows whether the programmer intended to clear the memory or not, so this weakness is indistinguishable from others.::METHOD:White Box:DESCRIPTION:This weakness is only detectable using white box methods (see black box detection factor). Careful analysis is required to determine if the code is likely to be removed by the compiler.::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Store the sensitive data in a volatile memory location if available.::PHASE:Build and Compilation:DESCRIPTION:If possible, configure your compiler so that it does not remove dead stores.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Where possible, encrypt sensitive data that are used by a software system.::",,,::Memory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Insecure Compiler Optimization::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Sensitive memory uncleared by compiler optimization::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A8:ENTRY NAME:Insecure Storage:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MSC06-C:ENTRY NAME:Be aware of compiler optimization when dealing with sensitive data::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,,,
