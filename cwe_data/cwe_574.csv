574,EJB Bad Practices: Use of Synchronization Primitives,Variant,Draft,The product violates the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification by using thread synchronization primitives.,"The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container. In this case, the product violates the following EJB guideline: An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances. The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: This rule is required to ensure consistent runtime semantics because while some EJB containers may use a single JVM to execute all enterprise bean's instances, others may distribute the instances across multiple JVMs.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:695:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:821:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not use Synchronization Primitives when writing EJBs.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP3:ENTRY NAME:Use of an improper API::,,,
