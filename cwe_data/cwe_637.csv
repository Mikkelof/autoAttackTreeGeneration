637,Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism'),Class,Draft,"The product uses a more complex mechanism than necessary, which could lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not correctly understood, modeled, configured, implemented, or used.","Security mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex security mechanisms may engender partial implementations and compatibility problems, with resulting mismatches in assumptions and implemented security. A corollary of this principle is that data specifications should be as simple as possible, because complex data specifications result in complex validation code. Complex tasks and systems may also need to be guarded by complex security checks, so simple systems should be preferred.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:657:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,::TERM:Unnecessary Complexity::,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Avoid complex security mechanisms when simpler ones would meet requirements. Avoid complex data models, and unnecessarily complex operations. Adopt architectures that provide guarantees, simplify understanding through elegance and abstraction, and that can be implemented similarly. Modularize, isolate and do not trust complex code, and apply other secure programming principles on these modules (e.g., least privilege) to mitigate vulnerabilities.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-6067:DESCRIPTION:Support for complex regular expressions leads to a resultant algorithmic complexity weakness (CWE-407).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-6067::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-1552:DESCRIPTION:Either a filename extension and a Content-Type header could be used to infer the file type, but the developer only checks the Content-Type, enabling unrestricted file upload (CWE-434).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1552::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-6479:DESCRIPTION:In Apache environments, a filename.php.gif can be redirected to the PHP interpreter instead of being sent as an image/gif directly to the user.
