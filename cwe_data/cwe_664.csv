664,Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime,Pillar,Draft,"The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.","Resources often have explicit instructions on how to be created, used and destroyed. When code does not follow these instructions, it can lead to unexpected behaviors and potentially exploitable states. Even without explicit instructions, various principles are expected to be adhered to, such as Do not use an object until after its creation is complete, or do not use an object after it has been slated for destruction.",,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other::,,::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use Static analysis tools to check for unreleased resources.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-1000613:DESCRIPTION:Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000613::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-21668:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FIO39-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not alternately input and output from a stream without an intervening flush or positioning call:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::,::196::21::60::61::62::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:More work is needed on this entry and its children.

Others do not specify as many bases or variants, such as CWE-704, which primarily covers numbers at this stage.::",
