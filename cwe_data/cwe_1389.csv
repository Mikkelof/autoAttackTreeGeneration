1389,Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices,Base,Incomplete,"The product parses numeric input assuming base 10 (decimal) values, but it does not account for inputs that use a different base number (radix).","Frequently, a numeric input that begins with 0 is treated as octal, or 0x causes it to be treated as hexadecimal, e.g. by the inet_addr() function. For example, 023 (octal) is 35 decimal, or 0x31 is 49 decimal. Other bases may be used as well. If the developer assumes decimal-only inputs, the code could produce incorrect numbers when the inputs are parsed using a different base. This can result in unexpected and/or dangerous behavior. For example, a 0127.0.0.1 IP address is parsed as octal due to the leading 0, whose numeric value would be the same as 87.0.0.1 (decimal), where the developer likely expected to use 127.0.0.1. The consequences vary depending on the surrounding code in which this weakness occurs, but they can include bypassing network-based access control using unexpected IP addresses or netmasks, or causing apparently-symbolic identifiers to be processed as if they are numbers. In web applications, this can enable bypassing of SSRF restrictions.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:704:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Input validation used may assume decimal bases during conditional checks, when it may not always be the case.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:The application may rely on a service that supports different numerical bases.::",,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:LIKELIHOOD:Unknown:NOTE:An attacker may use an unexpected numerical base to access private application resources.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:LIKELIHOOD:Unknown:NOTE:An attacker may use an unexpected numerical base to bypass or manipulate access control mechanisms.::,,"::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Enforcement by Conversion:DESCRIPTION:If only decimal-based values are expected in the application, conditional checks should be created in a way that prevent octal or hexadecimal strings from being checked.
