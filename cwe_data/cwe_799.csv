799,Improper Control of Interaction Frequency,Class,Incomplete,"The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.","This can allow the actor to perform actions more frequently than expected. The actor could be a human or an automated process such as a virus or bot. This could be used to cause a denial of service, compromise program logic (such as limiting humans to a single vote), or other consequences. For example, an authentication routine might not limit the number of times an attacker can guess a password. Or, a web site might conduct a poll but only expect humans to vote a maximum of once a day.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:691:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:Insufficient anti-automation:DESCRIPTION:The term insufficient anti-automation focuses primarly on non-human actors such as viruses or bots, but the scope of this CWE entry is broader.::TERM:Brute force:DESCRIPTION:Vulnerabilities that can be targeted using brute force attacks are often symptomatic of this weakness.::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Other::,,,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1876:DESCRIPTION:Mail server allows attackers to prevent other users from accessing mail by sending large number of rapid requests.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1876::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:21:ENTRY NAME:Insufficient Anti-Automation::,,,
