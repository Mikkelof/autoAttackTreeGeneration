Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0696:DESCRIPTION:List directories using desired path and *:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0696::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0433:DESCRIPTION:List files in web server using *.ext:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0433::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:filedir* (asterisk / wildcard)::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP16:ENTRY NAME:Path Traversal::,,,
