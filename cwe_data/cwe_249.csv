249,DEPRECATED: Often Misused: Path Manipulation,Variant,Deprecated,This entry has been deprecated because of name confusion and an accidental combination of multiple weaknesses. Most of its content has been transferred to CWE-785.,"This entry was deprecated for several reasons. The primary reason is over-loading of the path manipulation term and the description. The original description for this entry was the same as that for the Often Misused: File System item in the original Seven Pernicious Kingdoms paper. However, Seven Pernicious Kingdoms also has a Path Manipulation phrase that is for external control of pathnames (CWE-73), which is a factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the phrase Often Misused: Path Manipulation for a broader range of problems, generally for issues related to buffer management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term, there is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped to this entry. The second reason for deprecation is an implied combination of multiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions. The focus of this entry was generally on the path-conversion functions and their association with buffer overflows. However, some of Fortify's Vulncat entries have the term path manipulation but describe a non-overflow weakness in which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire pathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see CWE-222 for a similar concept). A new entry for this non-overflow weakness may be created in a future version of CWE.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
