687,Function Call With Incorrectly Specified Argument Value,Variant,Draft,"The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies an argument that contains the wrong value, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:628:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation::,::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This might require an understanding of intended program behavior or design to determine whether the value is incorrect.::,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MEM04-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not perform zero length allocations::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP24:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to command::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:When primary, this weakness is most likely to occur in rarely-tested code, since the wrong value can change the semantic meaning of the program's execution and lead to obviously-incorrect behavior. It can also be resultant from issues in which the program assigns the wrong value to a variable, and that variable is later used in a function call. In that sense, this issue could be argued as having chaining relationships with many implementation errors in CWE.::",
