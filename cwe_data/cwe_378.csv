378,Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions,Base,Draft,"Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:377:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:If the temporary file can be read by the attacker, sensitive information may be in that file which could be revealed.::SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:If that file can be written to by the attacker, the file might be moved into a place to which the attacker does not have access. This will allow the attacker to gain selective resource access-control privileges.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Depending on the data stored in the temporary file, there is the potential for an attacker to gain an additional input vector which is trusted as non-malicious. It may be possible to make arbitrary changes to data structures, user information, or even process ownership.::",,::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Many contemporary languages have functions which properly handle this condition. Older C temp file functions are especially susceptible.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that you use proper file permissions. This can be achieved by using a safe temp file function. Temporary files should be writable and readable only by the process that owns the file.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Randomize temporary file names. This can also be achieved by using a safe temp-file function. This will ensure that temporary files will not be created in predictable places.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-24823:DESCRIPTION:A network application framework uses the Java function createTempFile(), which will create a file that is readable by other local users of the system:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24823::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Improper temp file opening::,,,
