261,Weak Encoding for Password,Base,Incomplete,Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.,"Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:522:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE::DESCRIPTION:Passwords should be encrypted with keys that are at least 128 bits in length for adequate security.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Password Management: Weak Cryptography::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A8:ENTRY NAME:Insecure Storage:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::,::55::,::TYPE:Other:NOTE:The crypt family of functions uses weak cryptographic algorithms and should be avoided.
