690,Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference,Compound,Draft,"The product does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference.","While unchecked return value weaknesses are not limited to returns of NULL pointers (see the examples in CWE-252), functions often return NULL to indicate an error status. When this error condition is not checked, a NULL pointer dereference can occur.",::NATURE:StartsWith:CWE ID:252:VIEW ID:709:CHAIN ID:690::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:252:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:A typical occurrence of this weakness occurs when an application includes user-controlled input to a malloc() call. The related code might be correct with respect to preventing buffer overflows, but if a large value is provided, the malloc() will fail due to insufficient memory. This problem also frequently occurs when a parsing routine expects that certain elements will always be present. If malformed input is provided, the parser might return NULL. For example, strtok() can return NULL.::",,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.::","::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:This typically occurs in rarely-triggered error conditions, reducing the chances of detection during black box testing.::METHOD:White Box:DESCRIPTION:Code analysis can require knowledge of API behaviors for library functions that might return NULL, reducing the chances of detection when unknown libraries are used.::",,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-1052:DESCRIPTION:Large Content-Length value leads to NULL pointer dereference when malloc fails.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1052::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-6227:DESCRIPTION:Large message length field leads to NULL pointer dereference when malloc fails.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6227::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-2555:DESCRIPTION:Parsing routine encounters NULL dereference when input is missing a colon separator.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-2555::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-1054:DESCRIPTION:URI parsing API sets argument to NULL when a parsing failure occurs, such as when the Referer header is missing a hostname, leading to NULL dereference.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1054::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-5183:DESCRIPTION:chain: unchecked return value can lead to NULL dereference:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-5183::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:EXP34-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not dereference null pointers:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR08-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not catch NullPointerException or any of its ancestors::TAXONOMY NAME:SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard:ENTRY ID:EXP32-PL:ENTRY NAME:Do not ignore function return values:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::,,,
