369,Divide By Zero,Base,Draft,The product divides a value by zero.,"This weakness typically occurs when an unexpected value is provided to the product, or if an error occurs that is not properly detected. It frequently occurs in calculations involving physical dimensions such as size, length, width, and height.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:A Divide by Zero results in a crash.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-3268:DESCRIPTION:Invalid size value leads to divide by zero.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3268::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-2723:DESCRIPTION:Empty content triggers divide by zero.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-2723::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-2237:DESCRIPTION:Height value of 0 triggers divide by zero.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-2237::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A9:ENTRY NAME:Denial of Service:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FLP03-C:ENTRY NAME:Detect and handle floating point errors::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT33-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that division and remainder operations do not result in divide-by-zero errors:MAPPING FIT:Exact::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:NUM02-J:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that division and modulo operations do not result in divide-by-zero errors::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::,,,
