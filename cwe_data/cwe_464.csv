464,Addition of Data Structure Sentinel,Base,Incomplete,The accidental addition of a data-structure sentinel can cause serious programming logic problems.,"Data-structure sentinels are often used to mark the structure of data. A common example of this is the null character at the end of strings or a special sentinel to mark the end of a linked list. It is dangerous to allow this type of control data to be easily accessible. Therefore, it is important to protect from the addition or modification of sentinels.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:138:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:NOTE:Generally this error will cause the data structure to not work properly by truncating the data.::,,"::PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Encapsulate the user from interacting with data sentinels. Validate user input to verify that sentinels are not present.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Proper error checking can reduce the risk of inadvertently introducing sentinel values into data. For example, if a parsing function fails or encounters an error, it might return a value that is the same as the sentinel.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs.
