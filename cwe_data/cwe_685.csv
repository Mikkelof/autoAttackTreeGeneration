685,Function Call With Incorrect Number of Arguments,Variant,Draft,"The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies too many arguments, or too few arguments, which may lead to undefined behavior and resultant weaknesses.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:628:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Perl:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:This problem typically occurs when the programmer makes a typo, or copy and paste errors.::",,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation::,"::METHOD:Other:DESCRIPTION:While this weakness might be caught by the compiler in some languages, it can occur more frequently in cases in which the called function accepts variable numbers of arguments, such as format strings in C. It also can occur in languages or environments that do not require that functions always be called with the correct number of arguments, such as Perl.::",::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Because this function call often produces incorrect behavior it will usually be detected during testing or normal operation of the product. During testing exercise all possible control paths will typically expose this weakness except in rare cases when the incorrect function call accidentally produces the correct results or if the provided argument type is very similar to the expected argument type.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:EXP37-C:ENTRY NAME:Call functions with the correct number and type of arguments:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FIO47-C:ENTRY NAME:Use valid format strings:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::,,,
