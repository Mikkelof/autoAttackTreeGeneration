317,Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI,Variant,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within the GUI.,"An attacker can often obtain data from a GUI, even if hidden, by using an API to directly access GUI objects such as windows and menus. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:312:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Windows:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Sometimes::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1848:DESCRIPTION:Unencrypted passwords stored in GUI dialog may allow local users to access the passwords.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1848::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Plaintext Storage in GUI::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Different people use cleartext and plaintext to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).::",
