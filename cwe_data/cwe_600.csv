600,Uncaught Exception in Servlet ,Variant,Draft,"The Servlet does not catch all exceptions, which may reveal sensitive debugging information.","When a Servlet throws an exception, the default error response the Servlet container sends back to the user typically includes debugging information. This information is of great value to an attacker. For example, a stack trace might show the attacker a malformed SQL query string, the type of database being used, and the version of the application container. This information enables the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:248:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:209:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:390:VIEW ID:1000::,,,,::TERM:Missing Catch Block::,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::",,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Implement Exception blocks to handle all types of Exceptions.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR01-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not allow exceptions to expose sensitive information::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP4:ENTRY NAME:Unchecked Status Condition::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The Missing Catch Block concept is probably broader than just Servlets, but the broader concept is not sufficiently covered in CWE.::",
