1074,Class with Excessively Deep Inheritance,Base,Incomplete,"A class has an inheritance level that is too high, i.e., it has a large number of parent classes.","This issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. While the interpretation of large number of parent classes may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 7 parent classes.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1093:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCMM:ENTRY ID:ASCMM-MNT-17::,,,
