1059,Insufficient Technical Documentation,Class,Incomplete,"The product does not contain sufficient technical or engineering documentation (whether on paper or in electronic form) that contains descriptions of all the relevant software/hardware elements of the product, such as its usage, structure, architectural components, interfaces, design, implementation, configuration, operation, etc.","When technical documentation is limited or lacking, products are more difficult to maintain. This indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. When using time-limited or labor-limited third-party/in-house security consulting services (such as threat modeling, vulnerability discovery, or pentesting), insufficient documentation can force those consultants to invest unnecessary time in learning how the product is organized, instead of focusing their expertise on finding the flaws or suggesting effective mitigations. With respect to hardware design, the lack of a formal, final manufacturer reference can make it difficult or impossible to evaluate the final product, including post-manufacture verification. One cannot ensure that design functionality or operation is within acceptable tolerances, conforms to specifications, and is free from unexpected behavior. Hardware-related documentation may include engineering artifacts such as hardware description language (HDLs), netlists, Gerber files, Bills of Materials, EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool files, etc.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:710:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Documentation::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context:IMPACT:Hide Activities:IMPACT:Reduce Reliability:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability:NOTE:Without a method of verification, one cannot be sure that everything only functions as expected.::",,::PHASE:Documentation Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that design documentation is detailed enough to allow for post-manufacturing verification.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-3203:DESCRIPTION:A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface (CWE-1059), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default (CWE-912).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3203::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 2-4:ENTRY NAME:Req SP.02.03 BR::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 2-4:ENTRY NAME:Req SP.02.03 RE(1)::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 2-4:ENTRY NAME:Req SP.03.03 RE(1)::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-1::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-2::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-3::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-4::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-5::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-6::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SG-7::,,,
