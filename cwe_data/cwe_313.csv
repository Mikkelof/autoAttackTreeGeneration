313,Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk,Variant,Draft,"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file, or on disk.","The sensitive information could be read by attackers with access to the file, or with physical or administrator access to the raw disk. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:312:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1481:DESCRIPTION:Cleartext credentials in world-readable file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1481::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1828:DESCRIPTION:Password in cleartext in config file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1828::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2209:DESCRIPTION:Password in cleartext in config file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2209::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1696:DESCRIPTION:Decrypted copy of a message written to disk given a combination of options and when user replies to an encrypted message.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1696::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2397:DESCRIPTION:Cleartext storage of private key and passphrase in log file when user imports the key.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2397::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Plaintext Storage in File or on Disk::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Different people use cleartext and plaintext to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).::",
