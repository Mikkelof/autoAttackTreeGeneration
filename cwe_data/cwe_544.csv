544,Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism,Base,Draft,"The product does not use a standardized method for handling errors throughout the code, which might introduce inconsistent error handling and resultant weaknesses.","If the product handles error messages individually, on a one-by-one basis, this is likely to result in inconsistent error handling. The causes of errors may be lost. Also, detailed information about the causes of an error may be unintentionally returned to the user.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:755:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:IMPACT:Unexpected State:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:define a strategy for handling errors of different severities, such as fatal errors versus basic log events. Use or create built-in language features, or an external package, that provides an easy-to-use API and define coding standards for the detection and handling of errors.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:ERR00-C:ENTRY NAME:Adopt and implement a consistent and comprehensive error-handling policy::,,,
