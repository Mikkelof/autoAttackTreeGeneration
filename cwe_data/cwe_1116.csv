1116,Inaccurate Comments,Base,Incomplete,The source code contains comments that do not accurately describe or explain aspects of the portion of the code with which the comment is associated.,"When a comment does not accurately reflect the associated code elements, this can introduce confusion to a reviewer (due to inconsistencies) or make it more difficult and less efficient to validate that the code is implementing the intended behavior correctly. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1078:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Verify that each comment accurately reflects what is intended to happen during execution of the code.::,,,,,,,
