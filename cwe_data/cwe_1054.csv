1054,Invocation of a Control Element at an Unnecessarily Deep Horizontal Layer,Base,Incomplete,"The code at one architectural layer invokes code that resides at a deeper layer than the adjacent layer, i.e., the invocation skips at least one layer, and the invoked code is not part of a vertical utility layer that can be referenced from any horizontal layer.","This issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1061:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCMM:ENTRY ID:ASCMM-MNT-12::,,,
