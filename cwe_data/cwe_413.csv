413,Improper Resource Locking,Base,Draft,The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.,"When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:667:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:DoS: Instability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
