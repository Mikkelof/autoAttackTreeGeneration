108,Struts: Unvalidated Action Form,Variant,Incomplete,Every Action Form must have a corresponding validation form.,"If a Struts Action Form Mapping specifies a form, it must have a validation form defined under the Struts Validator.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1173:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:20:VIEW ID:700:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:If an action form mapping does not have a validation form defined, it may be vulnerable to a number of attacks that rely on unchecked input. Unchecked input is the root cause of some of today's worst and most common software security problems. Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and process control vulnerabilities all stem from incomplete or absent input validation.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Map every Action Form to a corresponding validation form. An action or a form may perform validation in other ways, but the Struts Validator provides an excellent way to verify that all input receives at least a basic level of validation. Without this approach, it is difficult, and often impossible, to establish with a high level of confidence that all input is validated.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Struts: Unvalidated Action Form::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP24:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to command::,,,
