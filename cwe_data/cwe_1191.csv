1191,On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control,Base,Stable,The chip does not implement or does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.,"A device's internal information may be accessed through a scan chain of interconnected internal registers, usually through a JTAG interface. The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present. If authorization, authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through the debug interface. Sometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug pins on the motherboard. Instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate layers of the board. This is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization inside the chip. In such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:LIKELIHOOD:High::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory:LIKELIHOOD:High::SCOPE:Authorization:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:LIKELIHOOD:High::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:LIKELIHOOD:High::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:LIKELIHOOD:High::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:LIKELIHOOD:High::,::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:Authentication and authorization of debug and test interfaces should be part of the architecture and design review process.

If authentication logic is added, it should be resistant to timing attacks.

CWE-1191 is effectively about missing authorization for a debug interface, i.e. JTAG. CWE-1244 is about providing internal assets with the wrong debug access level, exposing the asset to untrusted debug agents.::",
