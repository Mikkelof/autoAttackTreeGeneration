214,Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information,Base,Incomplete,"A process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.","Many operating systems allow a user to list information about processes that are owned by other users. Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:497:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1387:DESCRIPTION:password passed on command line:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1387::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2291:DESCRIPTION:password passed on command line:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2291::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1565:DESCRIPTION:username/password on command line allows local users to view via ps or other process listing programs:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1565::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1948:DESCRIPTION:Username/password on command line allows local users to view via ps or other process listing programs.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1948::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-1270:DESCRIPTION:PGP passphrase provided as command line argument.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1270::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1058:DESCRIPTION:Kernel race condition allows reading of environment variables of a process that is still spawning.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1058::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-32638:DESCRIPTION:Code analysis product passes access tokens as a command-line parameter or through an environment variable, making them visible to other processes via the ps command.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32638::",,::System Process::,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Process information infoleak to other processes::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,,"::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-studied, especially environment variables.::",
