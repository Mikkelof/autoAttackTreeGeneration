323,"Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption",Base,Incomplete,Nonces should be used for the present occasion and only once.,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:344:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,::Nonces are often bundled with a key in a communication exchange to produce a new session key for each exchange.::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Potentially a replay attack, in which an attacker could send the same data twice, could be crafted if nonces are allowed to be reused. This could allow a user to send a message which masquerades as a valid message from a valid user.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Refuse to reuse nonce values.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use techniques such as requiring incrementing, time based and/or challenge response to assure uniqueness of nonces.::",,,,"::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Reusing a nonce, key pair in encryption::",,,
