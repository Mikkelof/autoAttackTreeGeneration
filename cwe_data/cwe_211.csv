211,Externally-Generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information,Base,Incomplete,"The product performs an operation that triggers an external diagnostic or error message that is not directly generated or controlled by the product, such as an error generated by the programming language interpreter that a software application uses. The error can contain sensitive system information.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:209:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Resultant::,::LANGUAGE NAME:PHP:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:PHP applications are often targeted for having this issue when the PHP interpreter generates the error outside of the application's control. However, other languages/environments exhibit the same issue.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::",,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,"::PHASE:System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Configure the application's environment in a way that prevents errors from being generated. For example, in PHP, disable display_errors.::PHASE:Implementation Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Debugging information should not make its way into a production release.::PHASE:Implementation Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Debugging information should not make its way into a production release.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Handle exceptions internally and do not display errors containing potentially sensitive information to a user. Create default error pages if necessary.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:The best way to prevent this weakness during implementation is to avoid any bugs that could trigger the external error message. This typically happens when the program encounters fatal errors, such as a divide-by-zero. You will not always be able to control the use of error pages, and you might not be using a language that handles exceptions.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1581:DESCRIPTION:chain: product does not protect against direct request of an include file, leading to resultant path disclosure when the include file does not successfully execute.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1581::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1579:DESCRIPTION:Single ' inserted into SQL query leads to invalid SQL query execution, triggering full path disclosure.
