834,Excessive Iteration,Class,Incomplete,The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.,"If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:691:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Amplification:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Excessive looping will cause unexpected consumption of resources, such as CPU cycles or memory. The product's operation may slow down, or cause a long time to respond. If limited resources such as memory are consumed for each iteration, the loop may eventually cause a crash or program exit due to exhaustion of resources, such as an out-of-memory error.::","::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Fuzz Tester Framework-based Fuzzer Forced Path Execution:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source Manual Source Code Review (not inspections):EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2011-1027:DESCRIPTION:Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1027::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-6499:DESCRIPTION:Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-6499::,,,,,,
