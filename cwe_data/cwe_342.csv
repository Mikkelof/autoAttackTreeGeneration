Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source might block.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1463:DESCRIPTION:Firewall generates easily predictable initial sequence numbers (ISN), which allows remote attackers to spoof connections.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1463::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-0074:DESCRIPTION:Listening TCP ports are sequentially allocated, allowing spoofing attacks.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-0074::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-0077:DESCRIPTION:Predictable TCP sequence numbers allow spoofing.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-0077::REFERENCE:CVE-2000-0335:DESCRIPTION:DNS resolver uses predictable IDs, allowing a local user to spoof DNS query results.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0335::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
