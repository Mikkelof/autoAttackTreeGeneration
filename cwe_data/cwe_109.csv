109,Struts: Validator Turned Off,Variant,Draft,"Automatic filtering via a Struts bean has been turned off, which disables the Struts Validator and custom validation logic. This exposes the application to other weaknesses related to insufficient input validation.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1173:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:20:VIEW ID:700:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that an action form mapping enables validation. Set the validate field to true.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Struts: Validator Turned Off::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP24:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to command::,,"::TYPE:Other:NOTE:The Action Form mapping in the demonstrative example disables the form's validate() method. The Struts bean: write tag automatically encodes special HTML characters, replacing a < with &lt; and a > with &gt;. This action can be disabled by specifying filter=false as an attribute of the tag to disable specified JSP pages. However, being disabled makes these pages susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks. An attacker may be able to insert malicious scripts as user input to write to these JSP pages.::",
