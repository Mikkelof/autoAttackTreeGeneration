Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2023-41151:DESCRIPTION:SDK for OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) server has uncaught exception when a socket is blocked for writing but the server tries to send an error:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41151::REFERENCE:CVE-2023-21087:DESCRIPTION:Java code in a smartphone OS can encounter a boot loop due to an uncaught exception:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-21087::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Often Misused: Exception Handling::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR05-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not let checked exceptions escape from a finally block::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR06-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not throw undeclared checked exceptions::TAXONOMY NAME:SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard:ENTRY ID:EXP31-PL:ENTRY NAME:Do not suppress or ignore exceptions:MAPPING FIT:Exact::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP4:ENTRY NAME:Unchecked Status Condition::,,,
