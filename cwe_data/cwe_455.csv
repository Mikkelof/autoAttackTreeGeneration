455,Non-exit on Failed Initialization,Base,Draft,"The product does not exit or otherwise modify its operation when security-relevant errors occur during initialization, such as when a configuration file has a format error or a hardware security module (HSM) cannot be activated, which can cause the product to execute in a less secure fashion than intended by the administrator.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:665:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:705:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:636:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:NOTE:The application could be placed in an insecure state that may allow an attacker to modify sensitive data or allow unintended logic to be executed.::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Follow the principle of failing securely when an error occurs. The system should enter a state where it is not vulnerable and will not display sensitive error messages to a potential attacker.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1345:DESCRIPTION:Product does not trigger a fatal error if missing or invalid ACLs are in a configuration file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1345::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Non-exit on Failed Initialization::,,"::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-studied.
