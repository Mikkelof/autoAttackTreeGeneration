337,Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG),Variant,Draft,"A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized from a predictable seed, such as the process ID or system time.",The use of predictable seeds significantly reduces the number of possible seeds that an attacker would need to test in order to predict which random numbers will be generated by the PRNG.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:335:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,"::PHASE::DESCRIPTION:Use non-predictable inputs for seed generation.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems, or use the more recent FIPS 140-3 [REF-1192] if possible.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source might block.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-7010:DESCRIPTION:Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7010::REFERENCE:CVE-2019-11495:DESCRIPTION:server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-11495::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-0166:DESCRIPTION:The removal of a couple lines of code caused Debian's OpenSSL Package to only use the current process ID for seeding a PRNG:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0166::REFERENCE:CVE-2016-10180:DESCRIPTION:Router's PIN generation is based on rand(time(0)) seeding.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10180::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-9057:DESCRIPTION:cloud provider product uses a non-cryptographically secure PRNG and seeds it with the current time:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-9057::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Predictable Seed in PRNG::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:MSC02-J:ENTRY NAME:Generate strong random numbers::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
