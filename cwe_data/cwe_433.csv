433,Unparsed Raw Web Content Delivery,Variant,Incomplete,The product stores raw content or supporting code under the web document root with an extension that is not specifically handled by the server.,"If code is stored in a file with an extension such as .inc or .pl, and the web server does not have a handler for that extension, then the server will likely send the contents of the file directly to the requester without the pre-processing that was expected. When that file contains sensitive information such as database credentials, this may allow the attacker to compromise the application or associated components.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:219:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Perform a type check before interpreting files.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Do not store sensitive information in files which may be misinterpreted.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1886:DESCRIPTION:.inc file stored under web document root and returned unparsed by the server:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1886::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-2065:DESCRIPTION:.inc file stored under web document root and returned unparsed by the server:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-2065::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2029:DESCRIPTION:.inc file stored under web document root and returned unparsed by the server:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2029::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0330:DESCRIPTION:direct request to .pl file leaves it unparsed:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0330::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0614:DESCRIPTION:.inc file:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0614::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2353:DESCRIPTION:unparsed config.conf file:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2353::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-3365:DESCRIPTION:Chain: uppercase file extensions causes web server to return script source code instead of executing the script.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3365::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Unparsed Raw Web Content Delivery::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This overlaps direct requests (CWE-425), alternate path (CWE-424), permissions (CWE-275), and sensitive file under web root (CWE-219).::",
