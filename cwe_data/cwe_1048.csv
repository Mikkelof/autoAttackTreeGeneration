1048,Invokable Control Element with Large Number of Outward Calls,Base,Incomplete,"The code contains callable control elements that contain an excessively large number of references to other application objects external to the context of the callable, i.e. a Fan-Out value that is excessively large.","While the interpretation of excessively large Fan-Out value may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 referenced objects. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:710:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCMM:ENTRY ID:ASCMM-MNT-4::,,,
