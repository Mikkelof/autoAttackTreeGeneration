128,Wrap-around Error,Base,Incomplete,"Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore wraps around to a very small, negative, or undefined value.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:119:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:190:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::,"::Due to how addition is performed by computers, if a primitive is incremented past the maximum value possible for its storage space, the system will not recognize this, and therefore increment each bit as if it still had extra space. Because of how negative numbers are represented in binary, primitives interpreted as signed may wrap to very large negative values.::",,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Instability:NOTE:This weakness will generally lead to undefined behavior and therefore crashes. In the case of overflows involving loop index variables, the likelihood of infinite loops is also high.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also, if the wrap around results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.::",,::PHASE::DESCRIPTION:Requirements specification: The choice could be made to use a language that is not susceptible to these issues.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Provide clear upper and lower bounds on the scale of any protocols designed.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Perform validation on all incremented variables to ensure that they remain within reasonable bounds.::,,,,"::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Wrap-around error::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MEM07-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that the arguments to calloc(), when multiplied, can be represented as a size_t::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::",::92::,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.::",
