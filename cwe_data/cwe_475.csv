475,Undefined Behavior for Input to API,Base,Incomplete,The behavior of this function is undefined unless its control parameter is set to a specific value.,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Undefined Behavior::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::,,"::TYPE:Other:NOTE:The Linux Standard Base Specification 2.0.1 for libc places constraints on the arguments to some internal functions [21]. If the constraints are not met, the behavior of the functions is not defined. It is unusual for this function to be called directly. It is almost always invoked through a macro defined in a system header file, and the macro ensures that the following constraints are met: The value 1 must be passed to the third parameter (the version number) of the following file system function: __xmknod The value 2 must be passed to the third parameter (the group argument) of the following wide character string functions: __wcstod_internal __wcstof_internal __wcstol_internal __wcstold_internal __wcstoul_internal The value 3 must be passed as the first parameter (the version number) of the following file system functions: __xstat __lxstat __fxstat __xstat64 __lxstat64 __fxstat64::",
