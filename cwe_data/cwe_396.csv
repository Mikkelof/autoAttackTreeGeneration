396,Declaration of Catch for Generic Exception,Base,Draft,Catching overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.,"Multiple catch blocks can get ugly and repetitive, but condensing catch blocks by catching a high-level class like Exception can obscure exceptions that deserve special treatment or that should not be caught at this point in the program. Catching an overly broad exception essentially defeats the purpose of a language's typed exceptions, and can become particularly dangerous if the program grows and begins to throw new types of exceptions. The new exception types will not receive any attention.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:705:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:755:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:221:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Python:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Hide Activities:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Overly-Broad Catch Block::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP5:ENTRY NAME:Ambiguous Exception Type::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCSM:ENTRY ID:ASCSM-CWE-396::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCRM:ENTRY ID:ASCRM-CWE-396::,,,
