1051,Initialization with Hard-Coded Network Resource Configuration Data,Base,Incomplete,The product initializes data using hard-coded values that act as network resource identifiers.,"This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. if it runs in an environment does not use the hard-coded network resource identifiers. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1419:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Reliability::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCRM:ENTRY ID:ASCRM-RLB-18::,,,
