694,Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses multiple resources that can have the same identifier, in a context in which unique identifiers are required.","If the product assumes that each resource has a unique identifier, the product could operate on the wrong resource if attackers can cause multiple resources to be associated with the same identifier.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:99:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:If unique identifiers are assumed when protecting sensitive resources, then duplicate identifiers might allow attackers to bypass the protection.::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation::",,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Where possible, use unique identifiers.
