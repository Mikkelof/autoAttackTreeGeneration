319,Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.,"Many communication channels can be sniffed (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data. Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries. When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to sniff the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:311:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:311:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Cloud Computing:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Often::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Test/Debug Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Often::,,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:For hardware, this may be introduced when design does not plan for an attacker having physical access while a legitimate user is remotely operating the device.::PHASE:Operation::PHASE:System Configuration::",,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories:NOTE:Anyone can read the information by gaining access to the channel being used for communication.::,"::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic. Attach the monitor to the process, trigger the feature that sends the data, and look for the presence or absence of common cryptographic functions in the call tree. Monitor the network and determine if the data packets contain readable commands. Tools exist for detecting if certain encodings are in use. If the traffic contains high entropy, this might indicate the usage of encryption.::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Before transmitting, encrypt the data using reliable, confidentiality-protecting cryptographic protocols.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When using web applications with SSL, use SSL for the entire session from login to logout, not just for the initial login page.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When designing hardware platforms, ensure that approved encryption algorithms (such as those recommended by NIST) protect paths from security critical data to trusted user applications.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:Configure servers to use encrypted channels for communication, which may include SSL or other secure protocols.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-29519:DESCRIPTION:Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29519::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30312:DESCRIPTION:Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30312::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-31204:DESCRIPTION:Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31204::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1949:DESCRIPTION:Passwords transmitted in cleartext.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1949::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-4122:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Use of HTTPS cookie without secure flag causes it to be transmitted across unencrypted HTTP.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4122::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-3289:DESCRIPTION:Product sends password hash in cleartext in violation of intended policy.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3289::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-4390:DESCRIPTION:Remote management feature sends sensitive information including passwords in cleartext.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4390::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-5626:DESCRIPTION:Backup routine sends password in cleartext in email.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5626::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1852:DESCRIPTION:Product transmits Blowfish encryption key in cleartext.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1852::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-0374:DESCRIPTION:Printer sends configuration information, including administrative password, in cleartext.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0374::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-4961:DESCRIPTION:Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password enables attacks against a server that is susceptible to replay (CWE-294).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4961::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-4786:DESCRIPTION:Product sends passwords in cleartext to a log server.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-4786::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-3140:DESCRIPTION:Product sends file with cleartext passwords in e-mail message intended for diagnostic purposes.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3140::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Plaintext Transmission of Sensitive Information::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:SEC06-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not rely on the default automatic signature verification provided by URLClassLoader and java.util.jar::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:SER02-J:ENTRY NAME:Sign then seal sensitive objects before sending them outside a trust boundary::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 3-3:ENTRY NAME:Req SR 4.1::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-2:ENTRY NAME:Req CR 4.1B::,::102::117::383::477::65::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions.
