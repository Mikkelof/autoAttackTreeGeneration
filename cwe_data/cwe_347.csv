Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1796:DESCRIPTION:Does not properly verify signatures for trusted entities.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1796::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2181:DESCRIPTION:Insufficient verification allows spoofing.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2181::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2182:DESCRIPTION:Insufficient verification allows spoofing.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2182::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1706:DESCRIPTION:Accepts a configuration file without a Message Integrity Check (MIC) signature.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1706::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Improperly Verified Signature::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:SEC06-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not rely on the default automatic signature verification provided by URLClassLoader and java.util.jar::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 3-3:ENTRY NAME:Req SR 1.9::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-1:ENTRY NAME:Req SM-6::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-2:ENTRY NAME:Req EDR 3.12::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-2:ENTRY NAME:Req NDR 3.12::TAXONOMY NAME:ISA/IEC 62443:ENTRY ID:Part 4-2:ENTRY NAME:Req HDR 3.12::,::463::475::,,
