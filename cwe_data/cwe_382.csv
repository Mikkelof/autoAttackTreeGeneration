382,J2EE Bad Practices: Use of System.exit(),Variant,Draft,"A J2EE application uses System.exit(), which also shuts down its container.",It is never a good idea for a web application to attempt to shut down the application container. Access to a function that can shut down the application is an avenue for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:705:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:A call to System.exit() is probably part of leftover debug code or code imported from a non-J2EE application.::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:The shutdown function should be a privileged function available only to a properly authorized administrative user::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Web applications should not call methods that cause the virtual machine to exit, such as System.exit()::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Web applications should also not throw any Throwables to the application server as this may adversely affect the container.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Non-web applications may have a main() method that contains a System.exit(), but generally should not call System.exit() from other locations in the code::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:J2EE Bad Practices: System.exit()::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A9:ENTRY NAME:Denial of Service:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR09-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not allow untrusted code to terminate the JVM::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP3:ENTRY NAME:Use of an improper API::,,,
