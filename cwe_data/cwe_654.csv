654,Reliance on a Single Factor in a Security Decision,Base,Draft,"A protection mechanism relies exclusively, or to a large extent, on the evaluation of a single condition or the integrity of a single object or entity in order to make a decision about granting access to restricted resources or functionality.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:657:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:693:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Some people and publications use the term Separation of Privilege to describe this weakness, but this term has dual meanings in current usage. While this entry is closely associated with the original definition of Separation of Privilege by Saltzer and Schroeder, others use the same term to describe poor compartmentalization (CWE-653). Because there are multiple interpretations, use of the Separation of Privilege term is discouraged.::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:If the single factor is compromised (e.g. by theft or spoofing), then the integrity of the entire security mechanism can be violated with respect to the user that is identified by that factor.::SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:IMPACT:Hide Activities:NOTE:It can become difficult or impossible for the product to be able to distinguish between legitimate activities by the entity who provided the factor, versus illegitimate activities by an attacker.::",,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use multiple simultaneous checks before granting access to critical operations or granting critical privileges.

This term is used in several different ways in the industry, but they generally combine two closely related principles: compartmentalization (CWE-653) and using only one factor in a security decision (this entry). Proper compartmentalization implicitly introduces multiple factors into a security decision, but there can be cases in which multiple factors are required for authentication or other mechanisms that do not involve compartmentalization, such as performing all required checks on a submitted certificate. It is likely that CWE-653 and CWE-654 will provoke further discussion.::",
