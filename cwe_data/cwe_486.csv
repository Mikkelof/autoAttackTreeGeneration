486,Comparison of Classes by Name,Variant,Draft,"The product compares classes by name, which can cause it to use the wrong class when multiple classes can have the same name.","If the decision to trust the methods and data of an object is based on the name of a class, it is possible for malicious users to send objects of the same name as trusted classes and thereby gain the trust afforded to known classes and types.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1025:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:If a product relies solely on the name of an object to determine identity, it may execute the incorrect or unintended code.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use class equivalency to determine type. Rather than use the class name to determine if an object is of a given type, use the getClass() method, and == operator.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Comparing Classes by Name::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Comparing classes by name::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:OBJ09-J:ENTRY NAME:Compare classes and not class names::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::,,,
