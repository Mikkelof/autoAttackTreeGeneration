341,Predictable from Observable State,Base,Draft,"A number or object is predictable based on observations that the attacker can make about the state of the system or network, such as time, process ID, etc.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:340:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:This weakness could be exploited by an attacker in a number ways depending on the context. If a predictable number is used to generate IDs or keys that are used within protection mechanisms, then an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system. If predictable filenames are used for storing sensitive information, then an attacker might gain access to the system and may be able to gain access to the information in the file.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Increase the entropy used to seed a PRNG.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source might block.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0389:DESCRIPTION:Mail server stores private mail messages with predictable filenames in a world-executable directory, which allows local users to read private mailing list archives.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0389::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1141:DESCRIPTION:PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future pseudo-random numbers.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1141::REFERENCE:CVE-2000-0335:DESCRIPTION:DNS resolver library uses predictable IDs, which allows a local attacker to spoof DNS query results.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0335::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1636:DESCRIPTION:MFV. predictable filename and insecure permissions allows file modification to execute SQL queries.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1636::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Predictable from Observable State::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
