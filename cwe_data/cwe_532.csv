532,Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File,Base,Incomplete,The product writes sensitive information to a log file.,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:538:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Logging sensitive user data, full path names, or system information often provides attackers with an additional, less-protected path to acquiring the information.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Consider seriously the sensitivity of the information written into log files. Do not write secrets into the log files.::PHASE:Distribution:DESCRIPTION:Remove debug log files before deploying the application into production.::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:Protect log files against unauthorized read/write.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Adjust configurations appropriately when software is transitioned from a debug state to production.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-9615:DESCRIPTION:verbose logging stores admin credentials in a world-readable log file:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9615::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-1999036:DESCRIPTION:SSH password for private key stored in build log:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1999036::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:FIO13-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not log sensitive information outside a trust boundary::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,::215::,,
