590,Free of Memory not on the Heap,Variant,Incomplete,"The product calls free() on a pointer to memory that was not allocated using associated heap allocation functions such as malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().","When free() is called on an invalid pointer, the program's memory management data structures may become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, an attacker may be able to cause free() to operate on controllable memory locations to modify critical program variables or execute code.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:762:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:123:VIEW ID:1000::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:There is the potential for arbitrary code execution with privileges of the vulnerable program via a write, what where primitive. If pointers to memory which hold user information are freed, a malicious user will be able to write 4 bytes anywhere in memory.::","::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Only free pointers that you have called malloc on previously. This is the recommended solution. Keep track of which pointers point at the beginning of valid chunks and free them only once.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Before freeing a pointer, the programmer should make sure that the pointer was previously allocated on the heap and that the memory belongs to the programmer. Freeing an unallocated pointer will cause undefined behavior in the program.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, glibc in Linux provides protection against free of invalid pointers.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use a language that provides abstractions for memory allocation and deallocation.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use a tool that dynamically detects memory management problems, such as valgrind.::",,,::Memory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MEM34-C:ENTRY NAME:Only free memory allocated dynamically:MAPPING FIT:Exact::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:WIN30-C:ENTRY NAME:Properly pair allocation and deallocation functions:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP12:ENTRY NAME:Faulty Memory Release::,,"::TYPE:Other:NOTE:In C++, if the new operator was used to allocate the memory, it may be allocated with the malloc(), calloc() or realloc() family of functions in the implementation. Someone aware of this behavior might choose to map this problem to CWE-590 or to its parent, CWE-762, depending on their perspective.::",
