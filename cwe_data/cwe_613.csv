613,Insufficient Session Expiration,Base,Incomplete,"According to WASC, Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:672:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:672:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:287:VIEW ID:1000::,,,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Set sessions/credentials expiration date.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:47:ENTRY NAME:Insufficient Session Expiration::,,"::TYPE:Other:NOTE:The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.::",
