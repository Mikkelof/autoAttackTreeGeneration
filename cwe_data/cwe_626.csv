626,Null Byte Interaction Error (Poison Null Byte),Variant,Draft,The product does not properly handle null bytes or NUL characters when passing data between different representations or components.,"A null byte (NUL character) can have different meanings across representations or languages. For example, it is a string terminator in standard C libraries, but Perl and PHP strings do not treat it as a terminator. When two representations are crossed - such as when Perl or PHP invokes underlying C functionality - this can produce an interaction error with unexpected results. Similar issues have been reported for ASP. Other interpreters written in C might also be affected. The poison null byte is frequently useful in path traversal attacks by terminating hard-coded extensions that are added to a filename. It can play a role in regular expression processing in PHP.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:147:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:436:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:PHP:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Perl:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:ASP.NET:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Unexpected State::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Remove null bytes from all incoming strings.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-4155:DESCRIPTION:NUL byte bypasses PHP regular expression check:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-4155::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-3153:DESCRIPTION:inserting SQL after a NUL byte bypasses allowlist regexp, enabling SQL injection:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3153::",,,,,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Current usage of poison null byte is typically related to this C/Perl/PHP interaction error, but the original term in 1998 was applied to an off-by-one buffer overflow involving a null byte.::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:There are not many CVE examples, because the poison NULL byte is a design limitation, which typically is not included in CVE by itself. It is typically used as a facilitator manipulation to widen the scope of potential attacks against other vulnerabilities.::",
