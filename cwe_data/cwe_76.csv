76,Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements,Base,Draft,"The product correctly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes equivalent special elements.","The product may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the product may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a dangerous -e command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for --exec or other switches that have the same semantics.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:75:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other::,,::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter equivalent special element syntax from all input.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Equivalent Special Element Injection::,,,
