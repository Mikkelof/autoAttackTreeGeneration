909,Missing Initialization of Resource,Class,Incomplete,The product does not initialize a critical resource.,"Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:665:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:665:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:908:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::ORDINALITY:Resultant::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:When reusing a resource such as memory or a program variable, the original contents of that resource may not be cleared before it is sent to an untrusted party.::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:The uninitialized resource may contain values that cause program flow to change in ways that the programmer did not intend.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Explicitly initialize the resource before use.
