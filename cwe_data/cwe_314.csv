314,Cleartext Storage in the Registry,Variant,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in the registry.,"Attackers can read the information by accessing the registry key. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:312:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,,::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2227:DESCRIPTION:Cleartext passwords in registry key.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2227::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Plaintext Storage in Registry::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,::37::,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Different people use cleartext and plaintext to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).::",
