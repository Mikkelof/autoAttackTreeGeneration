298,Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration,Variant,Draft,"A certificate expiration is not validated or is incorrectly validated, so trust may be assigned to certificates that have been abandoned due to age.","When the expiration of a certificate is not taken into account, no trust has necessarily been conveyed through it. Therefore, the validity of the certificate cannot be verified and all benefit of the certificate is lost.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:295:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:672:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:When the software uses certificate pinning, the developer might not properly validate all relevant components of the certificate before pinning the certificate. This can make it difficult or expensive to test after the pinning is complete.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::",,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:The data read from the system vouched for by the expired certificate may be flawed due to malicious spoofing.::SCOPE:Authentication:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Trust afforded to the system in question - based on the expired certificate - may allow for spoofing attacks.::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Check for expired certificates and provide the user with adequate information about the nature of the problem and how to proceed.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the expiration.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Failure to validate certificate expiration::,,,
