215,Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code,Base,Draft,"The product inserts sensitive information into debugging code, which could expose this information if the debugging code is not disabled in production.","When debugging, it may be necessary to report detailed information to the programmer. However, if the debugging code is not disabled when the product is operating in a production environment, then this sensitive information may be exposed to attackers.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not leave debug statements that could be executed in the source code. Ensure that all debug information is eradicated before releasing the software.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2268:DESCRIPTION:Password exposed in debug information.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2268::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0918:DESCRIPTION:CGI script includes sensitive information in debug messages when an error is triggered.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0918::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-1078:DESCRIPTION:FTP client with debug option enabled shows password to the screen.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1078::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Infoleak Using Debug Information::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2007:ENTRY ID:A6:ENTRY NAME:Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A10:ENTRY NAME:Insecure Configuration Management:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,,::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This overlaps other categories.::,
