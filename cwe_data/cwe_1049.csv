1049,Excessive Data Query Operations in a Large Data Table,Base,Incomplete,The product performs a data query with a large number of joins and sub-queries on a large data table.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of large data table and large number of joins or sub-queries may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 1 million rows for a large data table, a default minimum of 5 joins, and a default minimum of 3 sub-queries.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1176:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Performance::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCPEM:ENTRY ID:ASCPEM-PRF-4::,,,
