1241,Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator,Base,Draft,The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.,"Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:330:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:In many cases, the design originally defines a cryptographically secure random number generator, but is then changed during implementation due to unforeseen constraints.::",,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:LIKELIHOOD:High::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:A true random number generator should be specified for cryptographic algorithms.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:A true random number generator should be implemented for cryptographic algorithms.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-3692:DESCRIPTION:PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3692::,,,,::97::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
