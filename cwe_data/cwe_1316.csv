1316,Fabric-Address Map Allows Programming of Unwarranted Overlaps of Protected and Unprotected Ranges,Base,Draft,"The address map of the on-chip fabric has protected and unprotected regions overlapping, allowing an attacker to bypass access control to the overlapping portion of the protected region.","Various ranges can be defined in the system-address map, either in the memory or in Memory-Mapped-IO (MMIO) space. These ranges are usually defined using special range registers that contain information, such as base address and size. Address decoding is the process of determining for which range the incoming transaction is destined. To ensure isolation, ranges containing secret data are access-control protected. Occasionally, these ranges could overlap. The overlap could either be intentional (e.g. due to a limited number of range registers or limited choice in choosing size of the range) or unintentional (e.g. introduced by errors). Some hardware designs allow dynamic remapping of address ranges assigned to peripheral MMIO ranges. In such designs, intentional address overlaps can be created through misconfiguration by malicious software. When protected and unprotected ranges overlap, an attacker could send a transaction and potentially compromise the protections in place, violating the principle of least privilege.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Bus/Interface Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authorization:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Modify Memory:LIKELIHOOD:Medium::,::METHOD:Automated Dynamic Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Review address map in specification to see if there are any overlapping ranges.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Negative testing of access control on overlapped ranges.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:When architecting the address map of the chip, ensure that protected and unprotected ranges are isolated and do not overlap.
