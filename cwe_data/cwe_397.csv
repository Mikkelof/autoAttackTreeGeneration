397,Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception,Base,Draft,Throwing overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.,"Declaring a method to throw Exception or Throwable makes it difficult for callers to perform proper error handling and error recovery. Java's exception mechanism, for example, is set up to make it easy for callers to anticipate what can go wrong and write code to handle each specific exceptional circumstance. Declaring that a method throws a generic form of exception defeats this system.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:705:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:221:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:703:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Hide Activities:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,,,,"::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Overly-Broad Throws Declaration::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR07-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not throw RuntimeException, Exception, or Throwable::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP5:ENTRY NAME:Ambiguous Exception Type::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCSM:ENTRY ID:ASCSM-CWE-397::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCRM:ENTRY ID:ASCRM-CWE-397::",,"::TYPE:Applicable Platform:NOTE:For C++, this weakness only applies to C++98, C++03, and C++11.
