493,Critical Public Variable Without Final Modifier,Variant,Draft,"The product has a critical public variable that is not final, which allows the variable to be modified to contain unexpected values.","If a field is non-final and public, it can be changed once the value is set by any function that has access to the class which contains the field. This could lead to a vulnerability if other parts of the program make assumptions about the contents of that field.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::Mobile code, such as a Java Applet, is code that is transmitted across a network and executed on a remote machine. Because mobile code developers have little if any control of the environment in which their code will execute, special security concerns become relevant. One of the biggest environmental threats results from the risk that the mobile code will run side-by-side with other, potentially malicious, mobile code. Because all of the popular web browsers execute code from multiple sources together in the same JVM, many of the security guidelines for mobile code are focused on preventing manipulation of your objects' state and behavior by adversaries who have access to the same virtual machine where your program is running.::Final provides security by only allowing non-mutable objects to be changed after being set. However, only objects which are not extended can be made final.::",,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:NOTE:The object could potentially be tampered with.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:The object could potentially allow the object to be read.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Declare all public fields as final when possible, especially if it is used to maintain internal state of an Applet or of classes used by an Applet. If a field must be public, then perform all appropriate sanity checks before accessing the field from your code.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Mobile Code: Non-Final Public Field::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Failure to provide confidentiality for stored data::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:OBJ10-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not use public static nonfinal variables::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP28:ENTRY NAME:Unexpected access points::,,,
