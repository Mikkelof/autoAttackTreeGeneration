599,Missing Validation of OpenSSL Certificate,Variant,Incomplete,The product uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL_get_verify_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.,"This could allow an attacker to use an invalid certificate to claim to be a trusted host, use expired certificates, or conduct other attacks that could be detected if the certificate is properly validated.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:295:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:The data read may not be properly secured, it might be viewed by an attacker.::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Trust afforded to the system in question may allow for spoofing or redirection attacks.::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:If the certificate is not checked, it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data under the guise of a trusted host. While the attacker in question may have a valid certificate, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site. In order to ensure data integrity, we must check that the certificate is valid, and that it pertains to the site we wish to access.::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that proper authentication is included in the system design.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Understand and properly implement all checks necessary to ensure the identity of entities involved in encrypted communications.::,,,,,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:CWE-295 and CWE-599 are very similar, although CWE-599 has a more narrow scope that is only applied to OpenSSL certificates. As a result, other children of CWE-295 can be regarded as children of CWE-599 as well. CWE's use of one-dimensional hierarchical relationships is not well-suited to handle different kinds of abstraction relationships based on concepts like types of resources (OpenSSL certificate as a child of any certificate) and types of behaviors (not validating expiration as a child of improper validation).::",
