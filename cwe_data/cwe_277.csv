277,Insecure Inherited Permissions,Variant,Draft,A product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:732:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Modify Application Data::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:DESCRIPTION:Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1841:DESCRIPTION:User's umask is used when creating temp files.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1841::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1786:DESCRIPTION:Insecure umask for core dumps [is the umask preserved or assigned?].:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1786::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Insecure inherited permissions::,,,
