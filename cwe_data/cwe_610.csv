610,Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere,Class,Draft,The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:664:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Modify Application Data::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-3032:DESCRIPTION:An email client does not block loading of remote objects in a nested document.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3032::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-45918:DESCRIPTION:Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using ../ sequences (CWE-24):LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-45918::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-1000613:DESCRIPTION:Cryptography API uses unsafe reflection when deserializing a private key:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1000613::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-11053:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Go-based Oauth2 reverse proxy can send the authenticated user to another site at the end of the authentication flow.

A symbolic link has a name; in general, it appears like any other file in the file system. However, the link includes a reference to another file, often in another directory - perhaps in another sphere of control. Many common library functions that accept filenames will follow a symbolic link and use the link's target instead.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 Resource Injection, as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the identifier used to access a system resource such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the resource injection term does not apply to path manipulation, which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.::",
