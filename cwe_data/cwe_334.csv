334,Small Space of Random Values,Base,Draft,"The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:330:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:An attacker could easily guess the values used. This could lead to unauthorized access to a system if the seed is used for authentication and authorization.::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0583:DESCRIPTION:Product uses 5 alphanumeric characters for filenames of expense claim reports, stored under web root.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0583::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0903:DESCRIPTION:Product uses small number of random numbers for a code to approve an action, and also uses predictable new user IDs, allowing attackers to hijack new accounts.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0903::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-1230:DESCRIPTION:SYN cookies implementation only uses 32-bit keys, making it easier to brute force ISN.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-1230::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0230:DESCRIPTION:Complex predictability / randomness (reduced space).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0230::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Small Space of Random Values::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
