682,Incorrect Calculation,Pillar,Draft,The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.,"When product performs a security-critical calculation incorrectly, it might lead to incorrect resource allocations, incorrect privilege assignments, or failed comparisons among other things. Many of the direct results of an incorrect calculation can lead to even larger problems such as failed protection mechanisms or even arbitrary code execution.",::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:170:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:If the incorrect calculation causes the program to move into an unexpected state, it may lead to a crash or impairment of service.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:If the incorrect calculation is used in the context of resource allocation, it could lead to an out-of-bounds operation (CWE-119) leading to a crash or even arbitrary code execution. Alternatively, it may result in an integer overflow (CWE-190) and / or a resource consumption problem (CWE-400).::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:In the context of privilege or permissions assignment, an incorrect calculation can provide an attacker with access to sensitive resources.::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:If the incorrect calculation leads to an insufficient comparison (CWE-697), it may compromise a protection mechanism such as a validation routine and allow an attacker to bypass the security-critical code.::","::METHOD:Manual Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of allocation calculations. This can be useful for detecting overflow conditions (CWE-190) or similar weaknesses that might have serious security impacts on the program.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Understand your programming language's underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation. Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, not-a-number calculations, and how your language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use the appropriate type for the desired action. For example, in C/C++, only use unsigned types for values that could never be negative, such as height, width, or other numbers related to quantity.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Language Selection:DESCRIPTION:Use languages, libraries, or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences. Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++).::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use languages, libraries, or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences. Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++).::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-0022:DESCRIPTION:chain: mobile phone Bluetooth implementation does not include offset when calculating packet length (CWE-682), leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787):LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-0022::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1363:DESCRIPTION:substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1363::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FLP32-C:ENTRY NAME:Prevent or detect domain and range errors in math functions:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT07-C:ENTRY NAME:Use only explicitly signed or unsigned char type for numeric values::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT13-C:ENTRY NAME:Use bitwise operators only on unsigned operands::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT33-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that division and remainder operations do not result in divide-by-zero errors:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT34-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not shift an expression by a negative number of bits or by greater than or equal to the number of bits that exist in the operand:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::,::128::129::,"::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes.
