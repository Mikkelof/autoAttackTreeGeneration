1320,Improper Protection for Outbound Error Messages and Alert Signals,Base,Draft,Untrusted agents can disable alerts about signal conditions exceeding limits or the response mechanism that handles such alerts.,"Hardware sensors are used to detect whether a device is operating within design limits. The threshold values for these limits are set by hardware fuses or trusted software such as a BIOS. Modification of these limits may be protected by hardware mechanisms. When device sensors detect out of bound conditions, alert signals may be generated for remedial action, which may take the form of device shutdown or throttling. Warning signals that are not properly secured may be disabled or used to generate spurious alerts, causing degraded performance or denial-of-service (DoS). These alerts may be masked by untrusted software. Examples of these alerts involve thermal and power sensor alerts.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Microcontroller Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Memory Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Power Management Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Processor Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Test/Debug Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Sensor Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Instability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:Reduce Reliability:IMPACT:Unexpected State:LIKELIHOOD:High::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Alert signals generated by critical events should be protected from access by untrusted agents.
