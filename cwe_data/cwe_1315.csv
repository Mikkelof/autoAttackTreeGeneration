1315,Improper Setting of Bus Controlling Capability in Fabric End-point,Base,Incomplete,The bus controller enables bits in the fabric end-point to allow responder devices to control transactions on the fabric.,"To support reusability, certain fabric interfaces and end points provide a configurable register bit that allows IP blocks connected to the controller to access other peripherals connected to the fabric. This allows the end point to be used with devices that function as a controller or responder. If this bit is set by default in hardware, or if firmware incorrectly sets it later, a device intended to be a responder on a fabric is now capable of controlling transactions to other devices and might compromise system security.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:System Configuration::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:For responder devices, the register bit in the fabric end-point that enables the bus controlling capability must be set to 0 by default.
