1274,Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code,Base,Stable,"The product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) into Volatile Memory (VM), but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory.","Adversaries could bypass the secure-boot process and execute their own untrusted, malicious boot code. As a part of a secure-boot process, the read-only-memory (ROM) code for a System-on-Chip (SoC) or other system fetches bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and stores the code in Volatile Memory (VM), such as dynamic, random-access memory (DRAM) or static, random-access memory (SRAM). The NVM is usually external to the SoC, while the VM is internal to the SoC. As the code is transferred from NVM to VM, it is authenticated by the SoC's ROM code. If the volatile-memory-region protections or access controls are insufficient to prevent modifications from an adversary or untrusted agent, the secure boot may be bypassed or replaced with the execution of an adversary's code.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:This weakness can be introduced during hardware architecture or design but can be identified later during testing.::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:LIKELIHOOD:High::,"::METHOD:Manual Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Ensure the volatile memory is lockable or has locks.

Identify the volatile memory regions that are used for storing loaded system executable program. During system boot, test programming the identified memory regions in step 2 from all the masters identified in step 1. Only trusted masters should be allowed to write to the memory regions. For example, pluggable device peripherals should not have write access to program load memory regions.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that the design of volatile-memory protections is enough to prevent modification from an adversary or untrusted code.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Test the volatile-memory protections to ensure they are safe from modification or untrusted code.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2019-2267:DESCRIPTION:Locked memory regions may be modified through other interfaces in a secure-boot-loader image due to improper access control.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-2267::,,,,::456::679::,,
