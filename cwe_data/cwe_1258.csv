1258,Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information,Base,Draft,"The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered.","Security sensitive values, keys, intermediate steps of cryptographic operations, etc. are stored in temporary registers in the hardware.
