Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Least Privilege Violation::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Failure to drop privileges when reasonable::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:POS02-C:ENTRY NAME:Follow the principle of least privilege::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:SEC00-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not allow privileged blocks to leak sensitive information across a trust boundary::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:SEC01-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not allow tainted variables in privileged blocks::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP36:ENTRY NAME:Privilege::,::17::35::76::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:If system privileges are not dropped when it is reasonable to do so, this is not a vulnerability by itself. According to the principle of least privilege, access should be allowed only when it is absolutely necessary to the function of a given system, and only for the minimal necessary amount of time. Any further allowance of privilege widens the window of time during which a successful exploitation of the system will provide an attacker with that same privilege. If at all possible, limit the allowance of system privilege to small, simple sections of code that may be called atomically. When a program calls a privileged function, such as chroot(), it must first acquire root privilege. As soon as the privileged operation has completed, the program should drop root privilege and return to the privilege level of the invoking user.::",
