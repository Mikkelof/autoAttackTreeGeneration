1056,Invokable Control Element with Variadic Parameters,Base,Incomplete,A named-callable or method control element has a signature that supports a variable (variadic) number of parameters or arguments.,"This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability. With variadic arguments, it can be difficult or inefficient for manual analysis to be certain of which function/method is being invoked.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1120:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Reliability::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCRM:ENTRY ID:ASCRM-RLB-8::,,,
