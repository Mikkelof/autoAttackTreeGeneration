1122,Excessive Halstead Complexity,Base,Incomplete,The code is structured in a way that a Halstead complexity measure exceeds a desirable maximum.,"A variety of Halstead complexity measures exist, such as program vocabulary size or volume. This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1120:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability::,,,,,,,,,
