103,Struts: Incomplete validate() Method Definition,Variant,Draft,"The product has a validator form that either does not define a validate() method, or defines a validate() method but does not call super.validate().","If the code does not call super.validate(), the Validation Framework cannot check the contents of the form against a validation form. In other words, the validation framework will be disabled for the given form.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:20:VIEW ID:700:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::The Struts Validator uses a form's validate() method to check the contents of the form properties against the constraints specified in the associated validation form. That means the following classes have a validate() method that is part of the validation framework: ValidatorForm, ValidatorActionForm, DynaValidatorForm, and DynaValidatorActionForm. If the code creates a class that extends one of these classes, and if that class implements custom validation logic by overriding the validate() method, the code must call super.validate() in the validate() implementation.::",,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Disabling the validation framework for a form exposes the product to numerous types of attacks. Unchecked input is the root cause of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Implement the validate() method and call super.validate() within that method.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Struts: Erroneous validate() Method::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP24:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to command::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This could introduce other weaknesses related to missing input validation.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The current description implies a loose composite of two separate weaknesses, so this node might need to be split or converted into a low-level category.::",
