366,Race Condition within a Thread,Base,Draft,"If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:362:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:IMPACT:Unexpected State:NOTE:The main problem is that -- if a lock is overcome -- data could be altered in a bad state.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use locking functionality. This is the recommended solution. Implement some form of locking mechanism around code which alters or reads persistent data in a multithreaded environment.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Create resource-locking validation checks. If no inherent locking mechanisms exist, use flags and signals to enforce your own blocking scheme when resources are being used by other threads of execution.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-2621:DESCRIPTION:Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2621::",,::System Process::,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Race condition within a thread::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:CON32-C:ENTRY NAME:Prevent data races when accessing bit-fields from multiple threads:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:CON40-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not refer to an atomic variable twice in an expression:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:CON43-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not allow data races in multithreaded code:MAPPING FIT:Exact::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:VNA02-J:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that compound operations on shared variables are atomic::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:VNA03-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not assume that a group of calls to independently atomic methods is atomic::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP19:ENTRY NAME:Missing Lock::,::26::29::,,
