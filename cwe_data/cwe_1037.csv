1037,Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code,Base,Incomplete,"The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the processor optimizes the execution of the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1038:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary:DESCRIPTION:This weakness does not depend on other weaknesses and is the result of choices made by the processor in executing the specified application.::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Rarely::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Processor Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:Optimizations built into the design of the processor can have unintended consequences during the execution of an application.::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:LIKELIHOOD:High:NOTE:A successful exploitation of this weakness will change the order of an application's execution and will likely be used to bypass specific protection mechanisms. This bypass can be exploited further to potentially read data that should otherwise be unaccessible.::,::METHOD:White Box:DESCRIPTION:In theory this weakness can be detected through the use of white box testing techniques where specifically crafted test cases are used in conjunction with debuggers to verify the order of statements being executed.:EFFECTIVENESS:Opportunistic::,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-5715:DESCRIPTION:Intel, ARM, and AMD processor optimizations related to speculative execution and branch prediction cause access control checks to be bypassed when placing data into the cache. Often known as Spectre.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5715::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-5753:DESCRIPTION:Intel, ARM, and AMD processor optimizations related to speculative execution and branch prediction cause access control checks to be bypassed when placing data into the cache. Often known as Spectre.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5753::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-5754:DESCRIPTION:Intel processor optimizations related to speculative execution cause access control checks to be bypassed when placing data into the cache. Often known as Meltdown.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5754::",,,,::663::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are closely analyzing this entry and others to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks. Additional investigation may include other weaknesses related to microarchitectural state. As a result, this entry might change significantly in CWE 4.10.::",
