52,Path Equivalence: '/multiple/trailing/slash//',Variant,Incomplete,"The product accepts path input in the form of multiple trailing slash ('/multiple/trailing/slash//') without appropriate validation, which can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:41:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:163:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:289:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories::,,::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1078:DESCRIPTION:Directory listings in web server using multiple trailing slash:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1078::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:/multiple/trailing/slash// ('multiple trailing slash')::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP16:ENTRY NAME:Path Traversal::,,,
