524,Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information,Base,Incomplete,"The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an actor outside of the intended control sphere.","Applications may use caches to improve efficiency when communicating with remote entities or performing intensive calculations. A cache maintains a pool of objects, threads, connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other resources to minimize the time it takes to initialize and access these resources. If the cache is accessible to unauthorized actors, attackers can read the cache and obtain this sensitive information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Protect information stored in cache.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Do not store unnecessarily sensitive information in the cache.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Consider using encryption in the cache.::,,,,,::204::,,
