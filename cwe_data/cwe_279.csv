Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0265:DESCRIPTION:Log files opened read/write.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0265::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-0876:DESCRIPTION:Log files opened read/write.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0876::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1694:DESCRIPTION:Log files opened read/write.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1694::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Insecure execution-assigned permissions::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FIO06-C:ENTRY NAME:Create files with appropriate access permissions::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:FIO01-J:ENTRY NAME:Create files with appropriate access permission::,::81::,,
