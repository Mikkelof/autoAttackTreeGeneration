669,Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres,Class,Draft,"The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:664:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,"::A control sphere is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for administrators who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed. Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Unexpected State::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-22909:DESCRIPTION:Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with -k (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22909::REFERENCE:CVE-2023-5227:DESCRIPTION:PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5227::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-0406:DESCRIPTION:Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG.
