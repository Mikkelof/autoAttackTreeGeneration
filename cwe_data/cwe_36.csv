36,Absolute Path Traversal,Base,Draft,"The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as /abs/path that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.",This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:22:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:22:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:22:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:The attacker may be able to create or overwrite critical files that are used to execute code, such as programs or libraries.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories:NOTE:The attacker may be able to overwrite or create critical files, such as programs, libraries, or important data. If the targeted file is used for a security mechanism, then the attacker may be able to bypass that mechanism. For example, appending a new account at the end of a password file may allow an attacker to bypass authentication.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:NOTE:The attacker may be able read the contents of unexpected files and expose sensitive data. If the targeted file is used for a security mechanism, then the attacker may be able to bypass that mechanism. For example, by reading a password file, the attacker could conduct brute force password guessing attacks in order to break into an account on the system.::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:The attacker may be able to overwrite, delete, or corrupt unexpected critical files such as programs, libraries, or important data. This may prevent the product from working at all and in the case of a protection mechanisms such as authentication, it has the potential to lockout every user of the product.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-31503:DESCRIPTION:Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31503::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1345:DESCRIPTION:Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1345::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1269:DESCRIPTION:ZIP file extractor allows full path:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1269::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1818:DESCRIPTION:Path traversal using absolute pathname:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1818::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1913:DESCRIPTION:Path traversal using absolute pathname:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1913::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2147:DESCRIPTION:Path traversal using absolute pathname:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2147::REFERENCE:CVE-2000-0614:DESCRIPTION:Arbitrary files may be overwritten via compressed attachments that specify absolute path names for the decompressed output.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0614::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-1263:DESCRIPTION:Mail client allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via an e-mail message containing a uuencoded attachment that specifies the full pathname for the file to be modified.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1263::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-0753:DESCRIPTION:Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via a full pathname to the target file in config parameter.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0753::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1525:DESCRIPTION:Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an absolute pathname.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1525::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0038:DESCRIPTION:Remote attackers can read arbitrary files by specifying the drive letter in the requested URL.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0038::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0255:DESCRIPTION:FTP server allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories by using the ls command and including the drive letter name (e.g. C:) in the requested pathname.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0255::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0933:DESCRIPTION:FTP server allows remote attackers to list the contents of arbitrary drives via a ls command that includes the drive letter as an argument.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0933::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0466:DESCRIPTION:Server allows remote attackers to browse arbitrary directories via a full pathname in the arguments to certain dynamic pages.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0466::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1483:DESCRIPTION:Remote attackers can read arbitrary files via an HTTP request whose argument is a filename of the form C: (Drive letter), //absolute/path, or .. .:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1483::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2488:DESCRIPTION:FTP server read/access arbitrary files using C: filenames:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2488::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0687:DESCRIPTION:FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged web server system information by specifying arbitrary paths in the UNC format (computernamesharename).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0687::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Absolute Path Traversal::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP16:ENTRY NAME:Path Traversal::,::597::,,
