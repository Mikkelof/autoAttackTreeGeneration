Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not allow objects to modify private members of a class.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Public Data Assigned to Private Array-Typed Field::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP25:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to variable::,,,
