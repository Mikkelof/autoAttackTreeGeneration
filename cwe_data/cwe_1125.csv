1125,Excessive Attack Surface,Base,Incomplete,The product has an attack surface whose quantitative measurement exceeds a desirable maximum.,"Originating from software security, an attack surface measure typically reflects the number of input points and output points that can be utilized by an untrusted party, i.e. a potential attacker. A larger attack surface provides more places to attack, and more opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses. In some cases, this measure may reflect other aspects of quality besides security; e.g., a product with many inputs and outputs may require a large number of tests in order to improve code coverage.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1120:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
