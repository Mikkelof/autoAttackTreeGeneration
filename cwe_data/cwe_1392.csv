1392,Use of Default Credentials,Base,Incomplete,The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.,"It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys, passwords, or other mechanisms for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1391:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::,,,::SCOPE:Authentication:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::,,"::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Prohibit use of default, hard-coded, or other values that do not vary for each installation of the product - especially for separate organizations.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Force the administrator to change the credential upon installation.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Installation Operation:DESCRIPTION:The product administrator could change the defaults upon installation or during operation.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30270:DESCRIPTION:Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30270::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-41192:DESCRIPTION:data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41192::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-38759:DESCRIPTION:microcontroller board has default password:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-38759::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-3825:DESCRIPTION:cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-3825::REFERENCE:CVE-2010-2306:DESCRIPTION:Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2306::",,,,,,
