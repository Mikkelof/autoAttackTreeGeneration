Avoid passwords that are in any way similar to other passwords you have. Avoid using words that may be found in a dictionary, names book, on a map, etc. Consider incorporating numbers and/or punctuation into your password. If you do use common words, consider replacing letters in that word with numbers and punctuation. However, do not use similar-looking punctuation. For example, it is not a good idea to change cat to c@t, ca+, (@+, or anything similar. Finally, it is never appropriate to use an empty string as a password.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-26117:DESCRIPTION:Network access control (NAC) product has a configuration file with an empty password:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26117::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Password Management: Empty Password in Configuration File::,,,
