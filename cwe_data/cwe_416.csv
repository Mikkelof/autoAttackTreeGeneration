416,Use After Free,Variant,Stable,"The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory belongs to the code that operates on the new pointer.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:825:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:672:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:672:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:672:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:120:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:123:VIEW ID:1000::,"::ORDINALITY:Resultant:DESCRIPTION:If the product accesses a previously-freed pointer, then it means that a separate weakness or error already occurred previously, such as a race condition, an unexpected or poorly handled error condition, confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory, performing the free too soon, etc.::",::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:Dangling pointer:DESCRIPTION:a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed::TERM:UAF:DESCRIPTION:commonly used acronym for Use After Free::TERM:Use-After-Free::",::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:The use of previously freed memory may corrupt valid data, if the memory area in question has been allocated and used properly elsewhere.::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:If chunk consolidation occurs after the use of previously freed data, the process may crash when invalid data is used as chunk information.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:If malicious data is entered before chunk consolidation can take place, it may be possible to take advantage of a write-what-where primitive to execute arbitrary code. If the newly allocated data happens to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.::","::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Language Selection:DESCRIPTION:Choose a language that provides automatic memory management.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:DESCRIPTION:When freeing pointers, be sure to set them to NULL once they are freed.
