1189,Improper Isolation of Shared Resources on System-on-a-Chip (SoC),Base,Stable,The System-On-a-Chip (SoC) does not properly isolate shared resources between trusted and untrusted agents.,"A System-On-a-Chip (SoC) has a lot of functionality, but it may have a limited number of pins or pads. A pin can only perform one function at a time. However, it can be configured to perform multiple different functions. This technique is called pin multiplexing. Similarly, several resources on the chip may be shared to multiplex and support different features or functions. When such resources are shared between trusted and untrusted agents, untrusted agents may be able to access the assets intended to be accessed only by the trusted agents.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:653:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:1331:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:If resources being used by a trusted user are shared with an untrusted user, the untrusted user may be able to modify the functionality of the shared resource of the trusted user.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:NOTE:The functionality of the shared resource may be intentionally degraded.::","::METHOD:Automated Dynamic Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Pre-silicon / post-silicon: Test access to shared systems resources (memory ranges, control registers, etc.) from untrusted software to verify that the assets are not incorrectly exposed to untrusted agents.
