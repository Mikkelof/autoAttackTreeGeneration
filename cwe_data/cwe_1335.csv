1335,Incorrect Bitwise Shift of Integer,Base,Draft,An integer value is specified to be shifted by a negative amount or an amount greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in the value causing an unexpected or indeterminate result.,"Specifying a value to be shifted by a negative amount is undefined in various languages. Various computer architectures implement this action in different ways. The compilers and interpreters when generating code to accomplish a shift generally do not do a check for this issue. Specifying an over-shift, a shift greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in a value to be shifted, produces a result which varies by architecture and compiler. In some languages, this action is specifically listed as producing an undefined result.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:682:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:JavaScript:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Adding shifts without properly verifying the size and sign of the shift amount.::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::",,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Implicitly or explicitly add checks and mitigation for negative or over-shift values.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-4307:DESCRIPTION:An unexpected large value in the ext4 filesystem causes an overshift condition resulting in a divide by zero.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-4307::REFERENCE:CVE-2012-2100:DESCRIPTION:An unexpected large value in the ext4 filesystem causes an overshift condition resulting in a divide by zero - fix of CVE-2009-4307.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2100::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-8835:DESCRIPTION:An overshift in a kernel allowed out of bounds reads and writes resulting in a root takeover.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-8835::REFERENCE:CVE-2015-1607:DESCRIPTION:Program is not properly handling signed bitwise left-shifts causing an overlapping memcpy memory range error.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-1607::REFERENCE:CVE-2016-9842:DESCRIPTION:Compression function improperly executes a signed left shift of a negative integer.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-9842::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-18445:DESCRIPTION:Some kernels improperly handle right shifts of 32 bit numbers in a 64 bit register.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-18445::REFERENCE:CVE-2013-4206:DESCRIPTION:Putty has an incorrectly sized shift value resulting in an overshift.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-4206::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-20788:DESCRIPTION:LED driver overshifts under certain conditions resulting in a DoS.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-20788::,,,,,,
