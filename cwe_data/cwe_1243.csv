1243,Sensitive Non-Volatile Information Not Protected During Debug,Base,Incomplete,Access to security-sensitive information stored in fuses is not limited during debug.,"Several security-sensitive values are programmed into fuses to be used during early-boot flows or later at runtime. Examples of these security-sensitive values include root keys, encryption keys, manufacturing-specific information, chip-manufacturer-specific information, and original-equipment-manufacturer (OEM) data. After the chip is powered on, these values are sensed from fuses and stored in temporary locations such as registers and local memories. These locations are typically access-control protected from untrusted agents capable of accessing them. Even to trusted agents, only read-access is provided. However, these locations are not blocked during debug operations, allowing a user to access this sensitive information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1263:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Disable access to security-sensitive information stored in fuses directly and also reflected from temporary storage locations when in debug mode.::,,,,,::116::545::,,
