584,Return Inside Finally Block,Base,Draft,"The code has a return statement inside a finally block, which will cause any thrown exception in the try block to be discarded.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:705:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not use a return statement inside the finally block. The finally block should have cleanup code.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR04-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not complete abruptly from a finally block::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:ERR05-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not let checked exceptions escape from a finally block::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP6:ENTRY NAME:Incorrect Exception Behavior::,,,
