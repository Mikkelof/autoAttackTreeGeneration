500,Public Static Field Not Marked Final,Variant,Draft,"An object contains a public static field that is not marked final, which might allow it to be modified in unexpected ways.",Public static variables can be read without an accessor and changed without a mutator by any classes in the application.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:493:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::When a field is declared public but not final, the field can be read and written to by arbitrary Java code.::",,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:NOTE:The object could potentially be tampered with.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:The object could potentially allow the object to be read.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Clearly identify the scope for all critical data elements, including whether they should be regarded as static.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Make any static fields private and constant. A constant field is denoted by the keyword 'const' in C/C++ and ' final' in Java::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Overflow of static internal buffer::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:OBJ10-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not use public static nonfinal variables::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP28:ENTRY NAME:Unexpected access points::,,,
