318,Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Executable,Variant,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in an executable.,"Attackers can reverse engineer binary code to obtain secret data. This is especially easy when the cleartext is plain ASCII. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:312:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1794:DESCRIPTION:Product stores RSA private key in a DLL and uses it to sign a certificate, allowing spoofing of servers and Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attacks.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1794::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1527:DESCRIPTION:administration passwords in cleartext in executable:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1527::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Plaintext Storage in Executable::,::37::65::,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Different people use cleartext and plaintext to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).::",
