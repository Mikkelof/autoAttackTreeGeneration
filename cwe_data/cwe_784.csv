784,Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision,Variant,Draft,"The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.","Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Attackers can bypass protection mechanisms such as authorization and authentication by modifying the cookie to contain an expected value.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:807:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:565:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Web Based:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Often::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:It is dangerous to use cookies to set a user's privileges. The cookie can be manipulated to claim a high level of authorization, or to claim that successful authentication has occurred.::",,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Avoid using cookie data for a security-related decision.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Perform thorough input validation (i.e.: server side validation) on the cookie data if you're going to use it for a security related decision.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Add integrity checks to detect tampering.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Protect critical cookies from replay attacks, since cross-site scripting or other attacks may allow attackers to steal a strongly-encrypted cookie that also passes integrity checks. This mitigation applies to cookies that should only be valid during a single transaction or session. By enforcing timeouts, you may limit the scope of an attack. As part of your integrity check, use an unpredictable, server-side value that is not exposed to the client.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-1549:DESCRIPTION:Attacker can bypass authentication by setting a cookie to a specific value.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1549::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-1619:DESCRIPTION:Attacker can bypass authentication and gain admin privileges by setting an admin cookie to 1.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1619::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-0864:DESCRIPTION:Content management system allows admin privileges by setting a login cookie to OK.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0864::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-5784:DESCRIPTION:e-dating application allows admin privileges by setting the admin cookie to 1.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-5784::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-6291:DESCRIPTION:Web-based email list manager allows attackers to gain admin privileges by setting a login cookie to admin.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-6291::,,,,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:A new parent might need to be defined for this entry. This entry is specific to cookies, which reflects the significant number of vulnerabilities being reported for cookie-based authentication in CVE during 2008 and 2009. However, other types of inputs - such as parameters or headers - could also be used for similar authentication or authorization. Similar issues (under the Research view) include CWE-247 and CWE-472.::",
