543,Use of Singleton Pattern Without Synchronization in a Multithreaded Context,Variant,Incomplete,The product uses the singleton pattern when creating a resource within a multithreaded environment.,The use of a singleton pattern may not be thread-safe.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:820:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Other:IMPACT:Modify Application Data::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use the Thread-Specific Storage Pattern. See References.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not use member fields to store information in the Servlet. In multithreading environments, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Avoid using the double-checked locking pattern in language versions that cannot guarantee thread safety. This pattern may be used to avoid the overhead of a synchronized call, but in certain versions of Java (for example), this has been shown to be unsafe because it still introduces a race condition (CWE-209).:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:MSC07-J:ENTRY NAME:Prevent multiple instantiations of singleton objects::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP19:ENTRY NAME:Missing Lock::,,,
