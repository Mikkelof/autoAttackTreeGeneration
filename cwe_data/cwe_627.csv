627,Dynamic Variable Evaluation,Variant,Incomplete,"In a language where the user can influence the name of a variable at runtime, if the variable names are not controlled, an attacker can read or write to arbitrary variables, or access arbitrary functions.","The resultant vulnerabilities depend on the behavior of the application, both at the crossover point and in any control/data flow that is reachable by the related variables or functions.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:914:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:183:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:PHP:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Perl:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::Many interpreted languages support the use of a $$varname construct to set a variable whose name is specified by the $varname variable.

Few researchers look for this issue; most public reports are for PHP, although other languages are affected. This issue is likely to grow in PHP as developers begin to implement functionality in place of register_globals.::",
