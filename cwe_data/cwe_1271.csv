1271,Uninitialized Value on Reset for Registers Holding Security Settings,Base,Incomplete,Security-critical logic is not set to a known value on reset.,"When the device is first brought out of reset, the state of registers will be indeterminate if they have not been initialized by the logic. Before the registers are initialized, there will be a window during which the device is in an insecure state and may be vulnerable to attack.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:909:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authentication:SCOPE:Authorization:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Design checks should be performed to identify any uninitialized flip-flops used for security-critical functions.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:All registers holding security-critical information should be set to a specific value on reset.::,,,,,::74::,::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.::,
