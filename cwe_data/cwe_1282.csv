1282,Assumed-Immutable Data is Stored in Writable Memory,Base,Incomplete,"Immutable data, such as a first-stage bootloader, device identifiers, and write-once configuration settings are stored in writable memory that can be re-programmed or updated in the field.","Security services such as secure boot, authentication of code and data, and device attestation all require assets such as the first stage bootloader, public keys, golden hash digests, etc. which are implicitly trusted. Storing these assets in read-only memory (ROM), fuses, or one-time programmable (OTP) memory provides strong integrity guarantees and provides a root of trust for securing the rest of the system. Security is lost if assets assumed to be immutable can be modified.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:471:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Keys, code, configuration settings, and other data should be programmed in write-once or read-only memory instead of writable memory.::",,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:All immutable code or data should be programmed into ROM or write-once memory.::,,,,,::458::679::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.3, CWE-1282 and CWE-1233 are being investigated for potential duplication or overlap.::",
