269,Improper Privilege Management,Class,Draft,"The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:DESCRIPTION:Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Consider following the principle of separation of privilege.
