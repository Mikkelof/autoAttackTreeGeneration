260,Password in Configuration File,Base,Incomplete,The product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors who do not know the password.,"This can result in compromise of the system for which the password is used. An attacker could gain access to this file and learn the stored password or worse yet, change the password to one of their choosing.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:522:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Avoid storing passwords in easily accessible locations.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Consider storing cryptographic hashes of passwords as an alternative to storing in plaintext.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-38665:DESCRIPTION:A continuous delivery pipeline management tool stores an unencypted password in a configuration file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-38665::,,::File or Directory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Password Management: Password in Configuration File::,,,
