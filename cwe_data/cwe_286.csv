286,Incorrect User Management,Class,Incomplete,The product does not properly manage a user within its environment.,Users can be assigned to the wrong group (class) of permissions resulting in unintended access rights to sensitive objects.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-36109:DESCRIPTION:Containerization product does not record a user's supplementary group ID, allowing bypass of group restrictions.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-36109::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-1193:DESCRIPTION:Operating system assigns user to privileged wheel group, allowing the user to gain root privileges.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1193::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:User management errors::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This item needs more work. Possible sub-categories include: user in wrong group, and user with insecure profile or configuration. It also might be better expressed as a category than a weakness.::",
