299,Improper Check for Certificate Revocation,Base,Draft,"The product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.","An improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:295:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:404:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:When the product uses certificate pinning, the developer might not properly validate all relevant components of the certificate before pinning the certificate.
