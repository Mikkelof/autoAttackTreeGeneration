196,Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error,Variant,Draft,"The product uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the unsigned primitive can not be represented using a signed primitive.","Although less frequent an issue than signed-to-unsigned conversion, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be the perfect precursor to dangerous buffer underwrite conditions that allow attackers to move down the stack where they otherwise might not have access in a normal buffer overflow condition. Buffer underwrites occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values, and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:124:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:120:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Incorrect sign conversions generally lead to undefined behavior, and therefore crashes.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:If a poor cast lead to a buffer overflow or similar condition, data integrity may be affected.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:Improper signed-to-unsigned conversions without proper checking can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code.
