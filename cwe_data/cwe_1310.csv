1310,Missing Ability to Patch ROM Code,Base,Draft,Missing an ability to patch ROM code may leave a System or System-on-Chip (SoC) in a vulnerable state.,"A System or System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements a boot process utilizing security mechanisms such as Root-of-Trust (RoT) typically starts by executing code from a Read-only-Memory (ROM) component. The code in ROM is immutable, hence any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for the systems that are already in use. A common weakness is that the ROM does not have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the system gets shipped. This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary can compromise the SoC.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1329:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:This issue could be introduced during hardware architecture and design and can be identified later during Testing.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:This issue could be introduced during implementation and can be identified later during Testing.::PHASE:Integration:NOTE:This issue could be introduced during integration and can be identified later during Testing.::PHASE:Manufacturing:NOTE:This issue could be introduced during manufacturing and can be identified later during Testing.::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability:LIKELIHOOD:High:NOTE:When the system is unable to be patched, it can be left in a vulnerable state.::",,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Secure patch support to allow ROM code to be patched on the next boot.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Support patches that can be programmed in-field or during manufacturing through hardware fuses.
