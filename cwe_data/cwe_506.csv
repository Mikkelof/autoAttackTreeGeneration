506,Embedded Malicious Code,Class,Incomplete,The product contains code that appears to be malicious in nature.,"Malicious flaws have acquired colorful names, including Trojan horse, trapdoor, timebomb, and logic-bomb. A developer might insert malicious code with the intent to subvert the security of a product or its host system at some time in the future. It generally refers to a program that performs a useful service but exploits rights of the program's user in a way the user does not intend.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:912:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Bundling::PHASE:Distribution::PHASE:Installation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands::,"::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities & anomalies Generated Code Inspection:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Automated Monitored Execution:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Manual Source Code Review (not inspections):EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Origin Analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::","::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Remove the malicious code and start an effort to ensure that no more malicious code exists. This may require a detailed review of all code, as it is possible to hide a serious attack in only one or two lines of code. These lines may be located almost anywhere in an application and may have been intentionally obfuscated by the attacker.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-30877:DESCRIPTION:A command history tool was shipped with a code-execution backdoor inserted by a malicious party.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30877::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Landwehr:ENTRY NAME:Malicious::,::442::448::636::,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:The term Trojan horse was introduced by Dan Edwards and recorded by James Anderson [18] to characterize a particular computer security threat; it has been redefined many times [4,18-20].::",
