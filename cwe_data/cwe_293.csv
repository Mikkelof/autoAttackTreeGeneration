293,Using Referer Field for Authentication,Variant,Draft,"The referer field in HTTP requests can be easily modified and, as such, is not a valid means of message integrity checking.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:290:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::The referer field in HTML requests can be simply modified by malicious users, rendering it useless as a means of checking the validity of the request in question.::","::TERM:referrer:DESCRIPTION:While the proper spelling might be regarded as referrer, the HTTP RFCs and their implementations use referer, so this is regarded as the correct spelling.::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Actions, which may not be authorized otherwise, can be carried out as if they were validated by the server referred to.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:In order to usefully check if a given action is authorized, some means of strong authentication and method protection must be used. Use other means of authorization that cannot be simply spoofed.
