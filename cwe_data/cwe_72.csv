72,Improper Handling of Apple HFS+ Alternate Data Stream Path,Variant,Incomplete,The product does not properly handle special paths that may identify the data or resource fork of a file on the HFS+ file system.,"If the product chooses actions to take based on the file name, then if an attacker provides the data or resource fork, the product may take unexpected actions. Further, if the product intends to restrict access to a file, then an attacker might still be able to bypass intended access restrictions by requesting the data or resource fork for that file.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:66:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:macOS:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::The Apple HFS+ file system permits files to have multiple data input streams, accessible through special paths. The Mac OS X operating system provides a way to access the different data input streams through special paths and as an extended attribute: - Resource fork: file/..namedfork/rsrc, file/rsrc (deprecated), xattr:com.apple.ResourceFork - Data fork: file/..namedfork/data (only versions prior to Mac OS X v10.5) Additionally, on filesystems that lack native support for multiple streams, the resource fork and file metadata may be stored in a file with ._ prepended to the name. Forks can also be accessed through non-portable APIs. Forks inherit the file system access controls of the file they belong to. Programs need to control access to these paths, if the processing of a file system object is dependent on the structure of its path.::",,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories::,,,::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1084:DESCRIPTION:Server allows remote attackers to read files and resource fork content via HTTP requests to certain special file names related to multiple data streams in HFS+.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1084::,,,,,::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:This and similar problems exist because the same resource can have multiple identifiers that dictate which behavior can be performed on the resource.::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-studied::,
