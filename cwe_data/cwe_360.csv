360,Trust of System Event Data,Base,Incomplete,Security based on event locations are insecure and can be spoofed.,"Events are a messaging system which may provide control data to programs listening for events. Events often do not have any type of authentication framework to allow them to be verified from a trusted source. Any application, in Windows, on a given desktop can send a message to any window on the same desktop. There is no authentication framework for these messages. Therefore, any message can be used to manipulate any process on the desktop if the process does not check the validity and safeness of those messages.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:345:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:If one trusts the system-event information and executes commands based on it, one could potentially take actions based on a spoofed identity.::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Never trust or rely any of the information in an Event for security.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0213:DESCRIPTION:Attacker uses Shatter attack to bypass GUI-enforced protection for CVE-2003-0908.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0213::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Trust of system event data::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP29:ENTRY NAME:Faulty endpoint authentication::,,,
