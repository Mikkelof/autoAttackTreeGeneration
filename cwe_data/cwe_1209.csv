1209,Failure to Disable Reserved Bits,Base,Incomplete,"The reserved bits in a hardware design are not disabled prior to production. Typically, reserved bits are used for future capabilities and should not support any functional logic in the design. However, designers might covertly use these bits to debug or further develop new capabilities in production hardware. Adversaries with access to these bits will write to them in hopes of compromising hardware state.","Reserved bits are labeled as such so they can be allocated for a later purpose. They are not to do anything in the current design. However, designers might want to use these bits to debug or control/configure a future capability to help minimize time to market (TTM). If the logic being controlled by these bits is still enabled in production, an adversary could use the logic to induce unwanted/unsupported behavior in the hardware.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:710:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:The Designer and Implementer have to make a conscious choice to do this::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:The Designer and Implementer have to make a conscious choice to do this::PHASE:Documentation:NOTE:If documentation labels anything for future use, reserved, or the like, such labeling could indicate to an attacker a potential attack point::",,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Accountability:SCOPE:Authentication:SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:This type of weakness all depends on the capabilities of the logic being controlled or configured by the reserved bits.::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Include a feature to disable reserved bits.::PHASE:Integration:DESCRIPTION:Any writes to these reserve bits are blocked (e.g., ignored, access-protected, etc.), or an exception can be asserted.::",,,,,::121::,,
