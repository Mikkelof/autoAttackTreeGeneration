1292,Incorrect Conversion of Security Identifiers,Base,Draft,"The product implements a conversion mechanism to map certain bus-transaction signals to security identifiers. However, if the conversion is incorrectly implemented, untrusted agents can gain unauthorized access to the asset.","In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes) assets or perform certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute, etc.). Among various types of message information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a security identifier. This security identifier helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed actions (e.g., access an asset for read and writes). A typical bus connects several leader and follower agents. Some follower agents implement bus protocols differently from leader agents. A protocol conversion happens at a bridge to seamlessly connect different protocols on the bus. One example is a system that implements a leader with the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) protocol and a follower with the Open-Core Protocol (OCP). A bridge AHB-to-OCP is needed to translate the transaction from one form to the other. A common weakness that can exist in this scenario is that this conversion between protocols is implemented incorrectly, whereupon an untrusted agent may gain unauthorized access to an asset.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1294:VIEW ID:1194:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Bus/Interface Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design, then identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during hardware implementation, then identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases.::",,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:LIKELIHOOD:High::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Security identifier decoders must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Access and programming flows must be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.::,,,,,,,
