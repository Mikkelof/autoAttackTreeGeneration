924,Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel,Base,Incomplete,"The product establishes a communication channel with an endpoint and receives a message from that endpoint, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the message was not modified during transmission.",Attackers might be able to modify the message and spoof the endpoint by interfering with the data as it crosses the network or by redirecting the connection to a system under their control.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:345:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:345:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:If an attackers can spoof the endpoint, the attacker gains all the privileges that were intended for the original endpoint.::",,,,,,,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry should be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions, as it is likely an important design flaw that underlies (or chains to) other weaknesses.::",
