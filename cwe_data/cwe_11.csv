11,ASP.NET Misconfiguration: Creating Debug Binary,Variant,Draft,Debugging messages help attackers learn about the system and plan a form of attack.,ASP .NET applications can be configured to produce debug binaries. These binaries give detailed debugging messages and should not be used in production environments. Debug binaries are meant to be used in a development or testing environment and can pose a security risk if they are deployed to production.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:489:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:ASP.NET:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,::The debug attribute of the <compilation> tag defines whether compiled binaries should include debugging information. The use of debug binaries causes an application to provide as much information about itself as possible to the user.::,,::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Build and Compilation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Attackers can leverage the additional information they gain from debugging output to mount attacks targeted on the framework, database, or other resources used by the application.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Avoid releasing debug binaries into the production environment. Change the debug mode to false when the application is deployed into production.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:ASP.NET Misconfiguration: Creating Debug Binary::,,,
