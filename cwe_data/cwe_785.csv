785,Use of Path Manipulation Function without Maximum-sized Buffer,Variant,Incomplete,"The product invokes a function for normalizing paths or file names, but it provides an output buffer that is smaller than the maximum possible size, such as PATH_MAX.","Passing an inadequately-sized output buffer to a path manipulation function can result in a buffer overflow. Such functions include realpath(), readlink(), PathAppend(), and others.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:676:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:120:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:20:VIEW ID:700:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::Windows provides a large number of utility functions that manipulate buffers containing filenames. In most cases, the result is returned in a buffer that is passed in as input. (Usually the filename is modified in place.) Most functions require the buffer to be at least MAX_PATH bytes in length, but you should check the documentation for each function individually. If the buffer is not large enough to store the result of the manipulation, a buffer overflow can occur.::",,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart::",,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Always specify output buffers large enough to handle the maximum-size possible result from path manipulation functions.::,,,::Memory::File or Directory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Often Misused: File System::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP9:ENTRY NAME:Faulty String Expansion::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is at a much lower level of abstraction than most entries because it is function-specific. It also has significant overlap with other entries that can vary depending on the perspective. For example, incorrect usage could trigger either a stack-based overflow (CWE-121) or a heap-based overflow (CWE-122). The CWE team has not decided how to handle such entries.::",
