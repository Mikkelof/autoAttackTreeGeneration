925,Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver,Variant,Incomplete,The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.,"Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:940:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,::TERM:Intent Spoofing::,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Another application can impersonate the operating system and cause the software to perform an unintended action.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Before acting on the Intent, check the Intent Action to make sure it matches the expected System action.::",,,,,::499::,::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.::,
