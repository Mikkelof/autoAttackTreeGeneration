667,Improper Locking,Class,Draft,"The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.","Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):NOTE:Inconsistent locking discipline can lead to deadlock.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
