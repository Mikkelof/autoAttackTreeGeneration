1254,Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity,Base,Draft,"The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.","Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred. With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:208:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:697:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Authorization:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:The hardware designer should ensure that comparison logic is implemented so as to compare in one operation instead in smaller chunks.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2019-10482:DESCRIPTION:Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10482::REFERENCE:CVE-2019-10071:DESCRIPTION:Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10071::REFERENCE:CVE-2014-0984:DESCRIPTION:Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0984::",,,,::26::,::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted.
