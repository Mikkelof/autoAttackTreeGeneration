1296,Incorrect Chaining or Granularity of Debug Components,Base,Incomplete,The product's debug components contain incorrect chaining or granularity of debug components.,"For debugging and troubleshooting a chip, several hardware design elements are often implemented, including: Various Test Access Ports (TAPs) allow boundary scan commands to be executed. For scanning the internal components of a chip, there are scan cells that allow the chip to be used as a stimulus and response mechanism. Chipmakers might create custom methods to observe the internal components of their chips by placing various tracing hubs within their chip and creating hierarchical or interconnected structures among those hubs. Logic errors during design or synthesis could misconfigure the interconnection of the debug components, which could allow unintended access permissions.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Verilog:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:VHDL:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Processor Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Authentication:SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Accountability:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories:LIKELIHOOD:Medium:NOTE:Depending on the access to debug component(s) erroneously granted, an attacker could use the debug component to gain additional understanding about the system to further an attack and/or execute other commands.
