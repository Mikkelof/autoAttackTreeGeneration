333,Improper Handling of Insufficient Entropy in TRNG,Variant,Draft,True random number generators (TRNG) generally have a limited source of entropy and therefore can fail or block.,The rate at which true random numbers can be generated is limited. It is important that one uses them only when they are needed for security.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:331:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:755:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:A program may crash or block if it runs out of random numbers.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Rather than failing on a lack of random numbers, it is often preferable to wait for more numbers to be created.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Failure of TRNG::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:MSC02-J:ENTRY NAME:Generate strong random numbers::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
