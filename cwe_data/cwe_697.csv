697,Incorrect Comparison,Pillar,Incomplete,"The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.","This Pillar covers several possibilities: the comparison checks one factor incorrectly; the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all; the comparison checks the wrong factor.",,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Varies by Context::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-3116:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390):LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3116::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-15811:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15811::REFERENCE:CVE-2016-10003:DESCRIPTION:Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10003::",,,,::10::120::14::15::182::24::267::3::41::43::44::45::46::47::52::53::6::64::67::7::71::73::78::79::8::80::88::9::92::,"::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity (CWE-178), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses besides comparison. Also, in cryptography, certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in constant time, causing a timing-related information leak (CWE-208).::",
