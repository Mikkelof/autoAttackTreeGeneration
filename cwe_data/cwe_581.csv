581,Object Model Violation: Just One of Equals and Hashcode Defined,Variant,Draft,The product does not maintain equal hashcodes for equal objects.,"Java objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality. One of these invariants is that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. In other words, if a.equals(b) == true then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode().",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:697:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:If this invariant is not upheld, it is likely to cause trouble if objects of this class are stored in a collection. If the objects of the class in question are used as a key in a Hashtable or if they are inserted into a Map or Set, it is critical that equal objects have equal hashcodes.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Both Equals() and Hashcode() should be defined.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:MET09-J:ENTRY NAME:Classes that define an equals() method must also define a hashCode() method::,,,
