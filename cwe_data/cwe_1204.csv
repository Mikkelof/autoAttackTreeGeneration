1204,Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV),Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive.","By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:330:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:If the IV is not properly initialized, data that is encrypted can be compromised and information about the data can be leaked. See [REF-1179].::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Different cipher modes have different requirements for their IVs. When choosing and implementing a mode, it is important to understand those requirements in order to keep security guarantees intact. Generally, it is safest to generate a random IV, since it will be both unpredictable and have a very low chance of being non-unique. IVs do not have to be kept secret, so if generating duplicate IVs is a concern, a list of already-used IVs can be kept and checked against. NIST offers recommendations on generation of IVs for modes of which they have approved. These include options for when random IVs are not practical. For CBC, CFB, and OFB, see [REF-1175]; for GCM, see [REF-1178].::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-1472:DESCRIPTION:ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-1472::REFERENCE:CVE-2011-3389:DESCRIPTION:BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0.

Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
