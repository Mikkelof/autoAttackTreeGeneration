57,Path Equivalence: 'fakedir/../realdir/filename',Variant,Incomplete,"The product contains protection mechanisms to restrict access to 'realdir/filename', but it constructs pathnames using external input in the form of 'fakedir/../realdir/filename' that are not handled by those mechanisms. This allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions against the targeted file.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:41:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories::,,::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1152:DESCRIPTION:Proxy allows remote attackers to bypass denylist restrictions and connect to unauthorized web servers by modifying the requested URL, including (1) a // (double slash), (2) a /SUBDIR/.. where the desired file is in the parentdir, (3) a /./, or (4) URL-encoded characters.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1152::REFERENCE:CVE-2000-0191:DESCRIPTION:application check access for restricted URL before canonicalization:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0191::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1366:DESCRIPTION:CGI source disclosure using dirname/../cgi-bin:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1366::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:dirname/fakechild/../realchild/filename::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP16:ENTRY NAME:Path Traversal::,,::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:This is a manipulation that uses an injection for one consequence (containment violation using relative path) to achieve a different consequence (equivalence by alternate name).::,
