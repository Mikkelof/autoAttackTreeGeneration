268,Privilege Chaining,Base,Draft,"Two distinct privileges, roles, capabilities, or rights can be combined in a way that allows an entity to perform unsafe actions that would not be allowed without that combination.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:269:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:A user can be given or gain access rights of another user. This can give the user unauthorized access to sensitive information including the access information of another user.::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:DESCRIPTION:Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:DESCRIPTION:Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:STRATEGY:Environment Hardening:DESCRIPTION:Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1736:DESCRIPTION:Chaining of user rights.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1736::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1772:DESCRIPTION:Gain certain rights via privilege chaining in alternate channel.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1772::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1973:DESCRIPTION:Application is allowed to assign extra permissions to itself.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1973::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-0640:DESCRIPTION:operator user can overwrite usernames and passwords to gain admin privileges.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0640::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Privilege Chaining::,,::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:There is some conceptual overlap with Unsafe Privilege.::,
