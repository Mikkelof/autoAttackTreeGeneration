315,Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie,Variant,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a cookie.,"Attackers can use widely-available tools to view the cookie and read the sensitive information. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:312:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1800:DESCRIPTION:Admin password in cleartext in a cookie.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1800::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1537:DESCRIPTION:Default configuration has cleartext usernames/passwords in cookie.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1537::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1536:DESCRIPTION:Usernames/passwords in cleartext in cookies.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1536::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2160:DESCRIPTION:Authentication information stored in cleartext in a cookie.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2160::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Plaintext Storage in Cookie::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,::31::37::39::74::,"::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Different people use cleartext and plaintext to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).::",
