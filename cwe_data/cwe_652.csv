652,Improper Neutralization of Data within XQuery Expressions ('XQuery Injection'),Base,Incomplete,"The product uses external input to dynamically construct an XQuery expression used to retrieve data from an XML database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes that input. This allows an attacker to control the structure of the query.","The net effect is that the attacker will have control over the information selected from the XML database and may use that ability to control application flow, modify logic, retrieve unauthorized data, or bypass important checks (e.g. authentication).",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:943:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:91:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:An attacker might be able to read sensitive information from the XML database.::,,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use parameterized queries. This will help ensure separation between data plane and control plane.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Properly validate user input. Reject data where appropriate, filter where appropriate and escape where appropriate. Make sure input that will be used in XQL queries is safe in that context.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:46:ENTRY NAME:XQuery Injection::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP24:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to command::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This weakness is similar to other weaknesses that enable injection style attacks, such as SQL injection, command injection and LDAP injection. The main difference is that the target of attack here is the XML database.::",
