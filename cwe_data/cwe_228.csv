228,Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure,Class,Incomplete,The product does not handle or incorrectly handles input that is not syntactically well-formed with respect to the associated specification.,,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:703:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:707:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Unexpected State:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):NOTE:If an input is syntactically invalid, then processing the input could place the system in an unexpected state that could lead to a crash, consume available system resources or other unintended behaviors.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0270:DESCRIPTION:Anti-virus product has assert error when line length is non-numeric.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0270::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Structure and Validity Problems::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A7:ENTRY NAME:Improper Error Handling:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry needs more investigation. Public vulnerability research generally focuses on the manipulations that generate invalid structure, instead of the weaknesses that are exploited by those manipulations. For example, a common attack involves making a request that omits a required field, which can trigger a crash in some cases. The crash could be due to a named chain such as CWE-690 (Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference), but public reports rarely cover this aspect of a vulnerability.::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:The validity of input could be roughly classified along syntactic, semantic, and lexical dimensions. If the specification requires that an input value should be delimited with the [ and ] square brackets, then any input that does not follow this specification would be syntactically invalid. If the input between the brackets is expected to be a number, but the letters aaa are provided, then the input is syntactically invalid. If the input is a number and enclosed in brackets, but the number is outside of the allowable range, then it is semantically invalid. The inter-relationships between these properties - and their associated weaknesses- need further exploration.::",
