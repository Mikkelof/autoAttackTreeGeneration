821,Incorrect Synchronization,Base,Incomplete,"The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner, but it does not correctly synchronize access to the resource.","If access to a shared resource is not correctly synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,,,,,,,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.::",
