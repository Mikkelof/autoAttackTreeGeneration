789,Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value,Variant,Draft,"The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:770:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:476:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::ORDINALITY:Resultant::,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:Stack Exhaustion:DESCRIPTION:When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as stack exhaustion, which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.::",::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):NOTE:Not controlling memory allocation can result in a request for too much system memory, possibly leading to a crash of the application due to out-of-memory conditions, or the consumption of a large amount of memory on the system.::","::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Perform adequate input validation against any value that influences the amount of memory that is allocated. Define an appropriate strategy for handling requests that exceed the limit, and consider supporting a configuration option so that the administrator can extend the amount of memory to be used if necessary.::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:Run your program using system-provided resource limits for memory. This might still cause the program to crash or exit, but the impact to the rest of the system will be minimized.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-21668:DESCRIPTION:Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21668::REFERENCE:CVE-2010-3701:DESCRIPTION:program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3701::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-1708:DESCRIPTION:memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-1708::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-0977:DESCRIPTION:large value in a length field leads to memory consumption and crash when no more memory is available:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0977::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-3791:DESCRIPTION:large key size in game program triggers crash when a resizing function cannot allocate enough memory:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3791::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2589:DESCRIPTION:large Content-Length HTTP header value triggers application crash in instant messaging application due to failure in memory allocation:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2589::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:35:ENTRY NAME:SOAP Array Abuse::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MEM35-C:ENTRY NAME:Allocate sufficient memory for an object:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard:ENTRY ID:IDS32-PL:ENTRY NAME:Validate any integer that is used as an array index:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCSM:ENTRY ID:ASCSM-CWE-789::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.::TYPE:Applicable Platform:NOTE:Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.::",
