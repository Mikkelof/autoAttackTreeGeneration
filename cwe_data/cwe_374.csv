374,Passing Mutable Objects to an Untrusted Method,Base,Draft,The product sends non-cloned mutable data as an argument to a method or function.,"The function or method that has been called can alter or delete the mutable data. This could violate assumptions that the calling function has made about its state. In situations where unknown code is called with references to mutable data, this external code could make changes to the data sent. If this data was not previously cloned, the modified data might not be valid in the context of execution.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:Potentially data could be tampered with by another function which should not have been tampered with.::,,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Pass in data which should not be altered as constant or immutable.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Clone all mutable data before passing it into an external function . This is the preferred mitigation.
