563,Assignment to Variable without Use,Base,Draft,"The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store.","After the assignment, the variable is either assigned another value or goes out of scope. It is likely that the variable is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the unused variable points out a bug.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1164:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,::TERM:Unused Variable::,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:This weakness could be an indication of a bug in the program or a deprecated variable that was not removed and is an indication of poor quality. This could lead to further bugs and the introduction of weaknesses.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Remove unused variables from the code.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MSC00-C:ENTRY NAME:Compile cleanly at high warning levels::TAXONOMY NAME:SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard:ENTRY ID:MSC01-PL:ENTRY NAME:Detect and remove unused variables:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP2:ENTRY NAME:Unused Entities::,,,
