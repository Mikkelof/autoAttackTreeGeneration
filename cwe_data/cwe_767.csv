767,Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method,Base,Incomplete,The product defines a public method that reads or modifies a private variable.,"If an attacker modifies the variable to contain unexpected values, this could violate assumptions from other parts of the code. Additionally, if an attacker can read the private variable, it may expose sensitive information or make it easier to launch further attacks.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:668:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Other::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use class accessor and mutator methods appropriately. Perform validation when accepting data from a public method that is intended to modify a critical private variable. Also be sure that appropriate access controls are being applied when a public method interfaces with critical data.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Failure to protect stored data from modification::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::TAXONOMY NAME:SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard:ENTRY ID:OOP31-PL:ENTRY NAME:Do not access private variables or subroutines in other packages:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is closely associated with access control for public methods. If the public methods are restricted with proper access controls, then the information in the private variable will not be exposed to unexpected parties. There may be chaining or composite relationships between improper access controls and this weakness.::",
