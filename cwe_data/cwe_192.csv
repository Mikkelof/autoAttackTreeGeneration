192,Integer Coercion Error,Variant,Incomplete,"Integer coercion refers to a set of flaws pertaining to the type casting, extension, or truncation of primitive data types.","Several flaws fall under the category of integer coercion errors. For the most part, these errors in and of themselves result only in availability and data integrity issues. However, in some circumstances, they may result in other, more complicated security related flaws, such as buffer overflow conditions.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Integer coercion often leads to undefined states of execution resulting in infinite loops or crashes.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:In some cases, integer coercion errors can lead to exploitable buffer overflow conditions, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Integer coercion errors result in an incorrect value being stored for the variable in question.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:A language which throws exceptions on ambiguous data casts might be chosen.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Design objects and program flow such that multiple or complex casts are unnecessary::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that any data type casting that you must used is entirely understood in order to reduce the plausibility of error in use.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-2639:DESCRIPTION:Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787):LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2639::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Integer coercion error::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT02-C:ENTRY NAME:Understand integer conversion rules::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT05-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not use input functions to convert character data if they cannot handle all possible inputs::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT31-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that integer conversions do not result in lost or misinterpreted data:MAPPING FIT:Exact::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Within C, it might be that coercion is semantically different than casting, possibly depending on whether the programmer directly specifies the conversion, or if the compiler does it implicitly. This has implications for the presentation of this entry and others, such as CWE-681, and whether there is enough of a difference for these entries to be split.::",
