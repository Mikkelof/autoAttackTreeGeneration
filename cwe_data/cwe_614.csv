614,Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute,Variant,Draft,"The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:319:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Web Based:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Always set the secure attribute when the cookie should sent via HTTPS only.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-0462:DESCRIPTION:A product does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session with the product.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0462::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-3663:DESCRIPTION:A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3663::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-3662:DESCRIPTION:A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3662::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-0128:DESCRIPTION:A product does not set the secure flag for a cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-0128::",,,,::102::,,
