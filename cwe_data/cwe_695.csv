695,Use of Low-Level Functionality,Base,Incomplete,The product uses low-level functionality that is explicitly prohibited by the framework or specification under which the product is supposed to operate.,"The use of low-level functionality can violate the specification in unexpected ways that effectively disable built-in protection mechanisms, introduce exploitable inconsistencies, or otherwise expose the functionality to attack.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,,,,,::36::,,
