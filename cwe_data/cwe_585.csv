585,Empty Synchronized Block,Variant,Draft,The product contains an empty synchronized block.,An empty synchronized block does not actually accomplish any synchronization and may indicate a troubled section of code. An empty synchronized block can occur because code no longer needed within the synchronized block is commented out without removing the synchronized block.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1071:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Other:NOTE:An empty synchronized block will wait until nobody else is using the synchronizer being specified. While this may be part of the desired behavior, because you haven't protected the subsequent code by placing it inside the synchronized block, nothing is stopping somebody else from modifying whatever it was you were waiting for while you run the subsequent code.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When you come across an empty synchronized statement, or a synchronized statement in which the code has been commented out, try to determine what the original intentions were and whether or not the synchronized block is still necessary.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP21:ENTRY NAME:Multiple locks/unlocks::,,,
