243,Creation of chroot Jail Without Changing Working Directory,Variant,Draft,"The product uses the chroot() system call to create a jail, but does not change the working directory afterward. This does not prevent access to files outside of the jail.","Improper use of chroot() may allow attackers to escape from the chroot jail. The chroot() function call does not change the process's current working directory, so relative paths may still refer to file system resources outside of the chroot jail after chroot() has been called.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:669:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Resultant::,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Unix:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::The chroot() system call allows a process to change its perception of the root directory of the file system. After properly invoking chroot(), a process cannot access any files outside the directory tree defined by the new root directory. Such an environment is called a chroot jail and is commonly used to prevent the possibility that a processes could be subverted and used to access unauthorized files. For instance, many FTP servers run in chroot jails to prevent an attacker who discovers a new vulnerability in the server from being able to download the password file or other sensitive files on the system.::",,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,,,::File or Directory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Directory Restriction::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP17:ENTRY NAME:Failed chroot jail::,,,
