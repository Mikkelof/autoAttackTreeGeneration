1333,Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity,Base,Draft,"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.","Some regular expression engines have a feature called backtracking. If the token cannot match, the engine backtracks to a position that may result in a different token that can match. Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met: The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input. The input can fail to match the regular expression. The input can be long enough. Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:407:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:407:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:ReDoS:DESCRIPTION:ReDoS is an abbreviation of Regular expression Denial of Service.::TERM:Regular Expression Denial of Service:DESCRIPTION:While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.::TERM:Catastrophic backtracking:DESCRIPTION:This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.::","::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:A RegEx can be easy to create and read using unbounded matching characters, but the programmer might not consider the risk of excessive backtracking.::",,,::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):LIKELIHOOD:High::,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use regular expressions that do not support backtracking, e.g. by removing nested quantifiers.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Set backtracking limits in the configuration of the regular expression implementation, such as PHP's pcre.backtrack_limit.
