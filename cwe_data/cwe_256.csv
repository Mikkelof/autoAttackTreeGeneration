256,Plaintext Storage of a Password,Base,Incomplete,Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.,"Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:522:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,"::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:Developers sometimes believe that they cannot defend the application from someone who has access to the configuration, but this belief makes an attacker's job easier.::",,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
