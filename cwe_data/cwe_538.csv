538,Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory,Base,Draft,"The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::PHASE:Operation:NOTE:OMISSION: This weakness is caused by missing a security tactic during the architecture and design phase.::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Do not expose file and directory information to the user.::,::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-1999036:DESCRIPTION:SSH password for private key stored in build log:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1999036::,,,,::95::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Depending on usage, this could be a weakness or a category. Further study of all its children is needed, and the entire sub-tree may need to be clarified. The current organization is based primarily on the exposure of sensitive information as a consequence, instead of as a primary weakness.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:There is a close relationship with CWE-552, which is more focused on weaknesses. As a result, it may be more appropriate to convert CWE-538 to a category.::",
