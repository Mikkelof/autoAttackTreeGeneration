662,Improper Synchronization,Class,Draft,"The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.","Synchronization refers to a variety of behaviors and mechanisms that allow two or more independently-operating processes or threads to ensure that they operate on shared resources in predictable ways that do not interfere with each other. Some shared resource operations cannot be executed atomically; that is, multiple steps must be guaranteed to execute sequentially, without any interference by other processes. Synchronization mechanisms vary widely, but they may include locking, mutexes, and semaphores. When a multi-step operation on a shared resource cannot be guaranteed to execute independent of interference, then the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Improper synchronization could lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:664:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:691:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:362:VIEW ID:1000::,,,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic::,,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use industry standard APIs to synchronize your code.::,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-1782:DESCRIPTION:Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1782::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-0935:DESCRIPTION:Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0935::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:SIG00-C:ENTRY NAME:Mask signals handled by noninterruptible signal handlers::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:SIG31-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not access shared objects in signal handlers:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:State synchronization error::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:VNA03-J:ENTRY NAME:Do not assume that a group of calls to independently atomic methods is atomic::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP19:ENTRY NAME:Missing Lock::,::25::26::27::29::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms.
