1235,Incorrect Use of Autoboxing and Unboxing for Performance Critical Operations,Base,Incomplete,"The code uses boxed primitives, which may introduce inefficiencies into performance-critical operations.","Languages such as Java and C# support automatic conversion through their respective compilers from primitive types into objects of the corresponding wrapper classes, and vice versa. For example, a compiler might convert an int to Integer (called autoboxing) or an Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates forcing the programmer to perform these conversions manually, which makes the code cleaner. However, this feature comes at a cost of performance and can lead to resource exhaustion and impact availability when used with generic collections. Therefore, they should not be used for scientific computing or other performance critical operations. They are only suited to support impedance mismatch between reference types and primitives.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:400:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:The programmer may use boxed primitives when not strictly necessary.::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):IMPACT:Reduce Performance:LIKELIHOOD:Low:NOTE:Incorrect autoboxing/unboxing would result in reduced performance, which sometimes can lead to resource consumption issues.::",,::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use of boxed primitives should be limited to certain situations such as when calling methods with typed parameters.
