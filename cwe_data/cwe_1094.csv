1094,Excessive Index Range Scan for a Data Resource,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains an index range scan for a large data table, but the scan can cover a large number of rows.","This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of large data table and excessive index range may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a threshold of 1000000 table rows and a threshold of 10 for the index range.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:405:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Performance::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCPEM:ENTRY ID:ASCPEM-PRF-7::,,,
