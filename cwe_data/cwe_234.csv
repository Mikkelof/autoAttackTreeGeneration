234,Failure to Handle Missing Parameter,Variant,Incomplete,"If too few arguments are sent to a function, the function will still pop the expected number of arguments from the stack.

The term missing parameter was used in both PLOVER and CLASP, with completely different meanings. However, data from both taxonomies was merged into this entry. In PLOVER, it was meant to cover malformed inputs that do not contain required parameters, such as a missing parameter in a CGI request. This entry's observed examples and classification came from PLOVER. However, the description, demonstrative example, and other information are derived from CLASP. They are related to an incorrect number of function arguments, which is already covered by CWE-685.::",
