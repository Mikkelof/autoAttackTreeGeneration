567,Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context,Base,Draft,"The product does not properly synchronize shared data, such as static variables across threads, which can lead to undefined behavior and unpredictable data changes.","Within servlets, shared static variables are not protected from concurrent access, but servlets are multithreaded. This is a typical programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When a shared variable can be influenced by an attacker, one thread could wind up modifying the variable to contain data that is not valid for a different thread that is also using the data within the variable. Note that this weakness is not unique to servlets.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:820:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:662:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:488:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:IMPACT:DoS: Instability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:If the shared variable contains sensitive data, it may be manipulated or displayed in another user session.

Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Remove the use of static variables used between servlets. If this cannot be avoided, use synchronized access for these variables.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:VNA00-J:ENTRY NAME:Ensure visibility when accessing shared primitive variables::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:VNA02-J:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that compound operations on shared variables are atomic::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP19:ENTRY NAME:Missing Lock::,::25::,,
