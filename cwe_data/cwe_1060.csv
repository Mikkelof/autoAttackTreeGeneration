1060,Excessive Number of Inefficient Server-Side Data Accesses,Base,Incomplete,The product performs too many data queries without using efficient data processing functionality such as stored procedures.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of too many data queries may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 5 data queries for an inefficient function/procedure.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1120:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Indirect::,,,,,,,::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Performance::,,,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCPEM:ENTRY ID:ASCPEM-PRF-9::,,,
