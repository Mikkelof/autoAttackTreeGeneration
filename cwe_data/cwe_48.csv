48,Path Equivalence: 'file name' (Internal Whitespace),Variant,Incomplete,"The product accepts path input in the form of internal space ('file(SPACE)name') without appropriate validation, which can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:41:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories::,,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2000-0293:DESCRIPTION:Filenames with spaces allow arbitrary file deletion when the product does not properly quote them; some overlap with path traversal.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0293::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1567:DESCRIPTION:+ characters in query string converted to spaces before sensitive file/extension (internal space), leading to bypass of access restrictions to the file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1567::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:file(SPACE)name (internal space)::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A9:ENTRY NAME:Denial of Service:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP16:ENTRY NAME:Path Traversal::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:This weakness is likely to overlap quoting problems, e.g. the Program Files unquoted search path (CWE-428). It also could be an equivalence issue if filtering removes all extraneous spaces.::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Whitespace can be a factor in other weaknesses not directly related to equivalence. It can also be used to spoof icons or hide files with dangerous names (see icon manipulation and visual truncation in CWE-451).::",
