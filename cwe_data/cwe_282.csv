282,Improper Ownership Management,Class,Draft,"The product assigns the wrong ownership, or does not properly verify the ownership, of an object or resource.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:DESCRIPTION:Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-1999-1125:DESCRIPTION:Program runs setuid root but relies on a configuration file owned by a non-root user.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1125::,,::File or Directory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Ownership errors::,::17::35::,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).::",
