7,J2EE Misconfiguration: Missing Custom Error Page,Variant,Incomplete,The default error page of a web application should not display sensitive information about the product.,"A Web application must define a default error page for 4xx errors (e.g. 404), 5xx (e.g. 500) errors and catch java.lang.Throwable exceptions to prevent attackers from mining information from the application container's built-in error response. When an attacker explores a web site looking for vulnerabilities, the amount of information that the site provides is crucial to the eventual success or failure of any attempted attacks.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:756:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:A stack trace might show the attacker a malformed SQL query string, the type of database being used, and the version of the application container. This information enables the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Handle exceptions appropriately in source code.::PHASE:Implementation System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Always define appropriate error pages. The application configuration should specify a default error page in order to guarantee that the application will never leak error messages to an attacker. Handling standard HTTP error codes is useful and user-friendly in addition to being a good security practice, and a good configuration will also define a last-chance error handler that catches any exception that could possibly be thrown by the application.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not attempt to process an error or attempt to mask it.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Verify return values are correct and do not supply sensitive information about the system.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:J2EE Misconfiguration: Missing Error Handling::,,,
