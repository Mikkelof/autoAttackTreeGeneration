287,Improper Authentication,Class,Draft,"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Often::,,"::TERM:authentification:DESCRIPTION:An alternate term is authentification, which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.::TERM:AuthN:DESCRIPTION:AuthN is typically used as an abbreviation of authentication within the web application security community. It is also distinct from AuthZ, which is an abbreviation of authorization. The use of Auth as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.::TERM:AuthC:DESCRIPTION:AuthC is used as an abbreviation of authentication, but it appears to used less frequently than AuthN.::",::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:This weakness can lead to the exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors, possibly providing attackers with sensitive information or even execute arbitrary code.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis is useful for detecting certain types of authentication. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage of commonly-used authentication libraries. Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authentication schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require an established identity; an automated technique that detects the absence of authentication may report false positives.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. Manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of custom authentication mechanisms.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to
