454,External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores,Base,Draft,The product initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.,"A product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary, especially if they are initialized by users. The variables may have been initialized incorrectly. If an attacker can initialize the variable, then they can influence what the vulnerable system will do.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1419:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:456:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:PHP:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Application Data:NOTE:An attacker could gain access to and modify sensitive data or system information.::,,"::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:A product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking (e.g. input validation) is performed when relying on input from outside a trust boundary.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Avoid any external control of variables. If necessary, restrict the variables that can be modified using an allowlist, and use a different namespace or naming convention if possible.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-43468:DESCRIPTION:WordPress module sets internal variables based on external inputs, allowing false reporting of the number of views:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-43468::REFERENCE:CVE-2000-0959:DESCRIPTION:Does not clear dangerous environment variables, enabling symlink attack.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2000-0959::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0033:DESCRIPTION:Specify alternate configuration directory in environment variable, enabling untrusted path.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0033::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0872:DESCRIPTION:Dangerous environment variable not cleansed.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0872::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0084:DESCRIPTION:Specify arbitrary modules using environment variable.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-0084::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:External initialization of trusted variables or values::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP25:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to variable::,,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Overlaps Missing variable initialization, especially in PHP.::TYPE:Applicable Platform:NOTE:This is often found in PHP due to register_globals and the common practice of storing library/include files under the web document root so that they are available using a direct request.::",
