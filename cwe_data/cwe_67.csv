67,Improper Handling of Windows Device Names,Variant,Incomplete,"The product constructs pathnames from user input, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a pathname containing a Windows device name such as AUX or CON. This typically leads to denial of service or an information exposure when the application attempts to process the pathname as a regular file.","Not properly handling virtual filenames (e.g. AUX, CON, PRN, COM1, LPT1) can result in different types of vulnerabilities. In some cases an attacker can request a device via injection of a virtual filename in a URL, which may cause an error that leads to a denial of service or an error page that reveals sensitive information. A product that allows device names to bypass filtering runs the risk of an attacker injecting malicious code in a file with the name of a device.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:66:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Resultant::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Windows:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::Historically, there was a bug in the Windows operating system that caused a blue screen of death.
