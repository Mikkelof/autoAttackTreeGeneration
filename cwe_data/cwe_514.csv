514,Covert Channel,Class,Incomplete,A covert channel is a path that can be used to transfer information in a way not intended by the system's designers.,Typically the system has not given authorization for the transmission and has no knowledge of its occurrence.,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1229:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,"::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial::",,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Landwehr:ENTRY NAME:Covert Channel::,::463::,"::TYPE:Theoretical:NOTE:A covert channel can be thought of as an emergent resource, meaning that it was not an originally intended resource, however it exists due the application's behaviors.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.::",
