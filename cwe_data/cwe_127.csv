127,Buffer Under-read,Variant,Draft,The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.,"This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:125:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:786:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Memory::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:By reading out-of-bounds memory, an attacker might be able to get secret values, such as memory addresses, which can be bypass protection mechanisms such as ASLR in order to improve the reliability and likelihood of exploiting a separate weakness to achieve code execution instead of just denial of service.::",,,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-40985:DESCRIPTION:HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40985::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Buffer under-read::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP8:ENTRY NAME:Faulty Buffer Access::,,::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:Under-studied.::,
