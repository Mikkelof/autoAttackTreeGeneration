183,Permissive List of Allowed Inputs,Base,Draft,"The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:697:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:434:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,"::TERM:Allowlist / Allow List:DESCRIPTION:This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms.
