329,Generation of Predictable IV with CBC Mode,Variant,Draft,"The product generates and uses a predictable initialization Vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, which causes algorithms to be susceptible to dictionary attacks when they are encrypted under the same key.","CBC mode eliminates a weakness of Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode by allowing identical plaintext blocks to be encrypted to different ciphertext blocks. This is possible by the XOR-ing of an IV with the initial plaintext block so that every plaintext block in the chain is XOR'd with a different value before encryption. If IVs are reused, then identical plaintexts would be encrypted to identical ciphertexts. However, even if IVs are not identical but are predictable, then they still break the security of CBC mode against Chosen Plaintext Attacks (CPA).",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1204:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:573:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::CBC mode is a commonly used mode of operation for a block cipher. It works by XOR-ing an IV with the initial block of a plaintext prior to encryption and then XOR-ing each successive block of plaintext with the previous block of ciphertext before encryption. C_0 = IV C_i = E_k{M_i XOR C_{i-1}} When used properly, CBC mode provides security against chosen plaintext attacks. Having an unpredictable IV is a crucial underpinning of this. See [REF-1171].::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Developers might dismiss the importance of an unpredictable IV and choose an easier implementation to save effort, weakening the scheme in the process.::",,,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:If the IV is not properly initialized, data that is encrypted can be compromised and leak information.::","::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:NIST recommends two methods of generating unpredictable IVs for CBC mode [REF-1172]. The first is to generate the IV randomly. The second method is to encrypt a nonce with the same key and cipher to be used to encrypt the plaintext. In this case the nonce must be unique but can be predictable, since the block cipher will act as a pseudo random permutation.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-5408:DESCRIPTION:encryption functionality in an authentication framework uses a fixed null IV with CBC mode, allowing attackers to decrypt traffic in applications that use this functionality:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5408::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-17704:DESCRIPTION:messages for a door-unlocking product use a fixed IV in CBC mode, which is the same after each restart:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-17704::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-11133:DESCRIPTION:application uses AES in CBC mode, but the pseudo-random secret and IV are generated using math.random, which is not cryptographically strong.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-11133::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-3528:DESCRIPTION:Blowfish-CBC implementation constructs an IV where each byte is calculated modulo 8 instead of modulo 256, resulting in less than 12 bits for the effective IV length, and less than 4096 possible IV values.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3528::REFERENCE:CVE-2011-3389:DESCRIPTION:BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0.

Within the developer and other communities, randomness is used heavily. However, within cryptography, entropy is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.::",
