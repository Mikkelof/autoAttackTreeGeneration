606,Unchecked Input for Loop Condition,Base,Draft,"The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:834:VIEW ID:1000::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not use user-controlled data for loop conditions.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Perform input validation.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP25:ENTRY NAME:Tainted input to variable::TAXONOMY NAME:OMG ASCSM:ENTRY ID:ASCSM-CWE-606::,,,
