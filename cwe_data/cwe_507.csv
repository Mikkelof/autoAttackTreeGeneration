507,Trojan Horse,Base,Incomplete,"The product appears to contain benign or useful functionality, but it also contains code that is hidden from normal operation that violates the intended security policy of the user or the system administrator.",,::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:506:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands::,,::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:Most antivirus software scans for Trojan Horses.::PHASE:Installation:DESCRIPTION:Verify the integrity of the product that is being installed.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:Landwehr:ENTRY NAME:Trojan Horse::,::698::,"::TYPE:Other:NOTE:Potentially malicious dynamic code compiled at runtime can conceal any number of attacks that will not appear in the baseline. The use of dynamically compiled code could also allow the injection of attacks on post-deployed applications.::TYPE:Terminology:NOTE:Definitions of Trojan horse and related terms have varied widely over the years, but common usage in 2008 generally refers to software that performs a legitimate function, but also contains malicious code. Almost any malicious code can be called a Trojan horse, since the author of malicious code needs to disguise it somehow so that it will be invoked by a nonmalicious user (unless the author means also to invoke the code, in which case they presumably already possess the authorization to perform the intended sabotage). A Trojan horse that replicates itself by copying its code into other program files (see case MA1) is commonly referred to as a virus. One that replicates itself by creating new processes or files to contain its code, instead of modifying existing storage entities, is often called a worm. Denning provides a general discussion of these terms; differences of opinion about the term applicable to a particular flaw or its exploitations sometimes occur.::",
