205,Observable Behavioral Discrepancy,Base,Incomplete,"The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.","Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:203:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:514:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism::,,,::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-0208:DESCRIPTION:Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0208::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-2252:DESCRIPTION:Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-2252::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Behavioral Discrepancy Infoleak::TAXONOMY NAME:WASC:ENTRY ID:45:ENTRY NAME:Fingerprinting::,::541::580::,,
