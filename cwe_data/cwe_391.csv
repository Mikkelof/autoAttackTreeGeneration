Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:The choice between a language which has named or unnamed exceptions needs to be done. While unnamed exceptions exacerbate the chance of not properly dealing with an exception, named exceptions suffer from the up call version of the weak base class problem.::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:A language can be used which requires, at compile time, to catch all serious exceptions. However, one must make sure to use the most current version of the API as new exceptions could be added.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Catch all relevant exceptions. This is the recommended solution. Ensure that all exceptions are handled in such a way that you can be sure of the state of your system at any given moment.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Unchecked Return Value::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Empty Catch Block::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Uncaught exception::TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Top Ten 2004:ENTRY ID:A7:ENTRY NAME:Improper Error Handling:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Specific::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:ERR00-C:ENTRY NAME:Adopt and implement a consistent and comprehensive error-handling policy::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:ERR33-C:ENTRY NAME:Detect and handle standard library errors:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:ERR34-C:ENTRY NAME:Detect errors when converting a string to a number:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FLP32-C:ENTRY NAME:Prevent or detect domain and range errors in math functions:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:POS54-C:ENTRY NAME:Detect and handle POSIX library errors:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:SEI CERT Perl Coding Standard:ENTRY ID:EXP31-PL:ENTRY NAME:Do not suppress or ignore exceptions:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP4:ENTRY NAME:Unchecked Status Condition::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:This entry is slated for deprecation; it has multiple widespread interpretations by CWE analysts. It currently combines information from three different taxonomies, but each taxonomy is talking about a slightly different issue. CWE analysts might map to this entry based on any of these issues. 7PK has Empty Catch Block which has an association with empty exception block (CWE-1069); in this case, the exception has performed the check, but does not handle. In PLOVER there is Unchecked Return Value which is CWE-252, but unlike Empty Catch Block there isn't even a check of the issue - and Unchecked Error Condition implies lack of a check. For CLASP, Uncaught Exception (CWE-248) is associated with incorrect error propagation - uncovered in CWE 3.2 and earlier, at least. There are other issues related to error handling and checks.::TYPE:Other:NOTE:When a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of two assumptions: This method call can never fail. It doesn't matter if this call fails.::",
