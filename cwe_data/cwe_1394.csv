1394,Use of Default Cryptographic Key,Base,Incomplete,The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.,"It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise.
