Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Declare the method private.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Clone the member data and keep an unmodified version of the data private to the object.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Use public setter methods that govern how a private member can be modified.::,,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:Private Array-Typed Field Returned From A Public Method::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP23:ENTRY NAME:Exposed Data::,,,
