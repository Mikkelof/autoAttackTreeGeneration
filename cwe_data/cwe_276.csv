Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1941:DESCRIPTION:Executables installed world-writable.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1941::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1713:DESCRIPTION:Home directories installed world-readable.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1713::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1550:DESCRIPTION:World-writable log files allow information loss; world-readable file has cleartext passwords.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2001-1550::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1711:DESCRIPTION:World-readable directory.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1711::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1844:DESCRIPTION:Windows product uses insecure permissions when installing on Solaris (genesis: port error).:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1844::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-0497:DESCRIPTION:Insecure permissions for a shared secret key file.
