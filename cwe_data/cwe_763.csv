763,Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference,Base,Incomplete,"The product attempts to return a memory resource to the system, but it calls the wrong release function or calls the appropriate release function incorrectly.","This weakness can take several forms, such as: The memory was allocated, explicitly or implicitly, via one memory management method and deallocated using a different, non-compatible function (CWE-762). The function calls or memory management routines chosen are appropriate, however they are used incorrectly, such as in CWE-761.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:404:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:404:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:404:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::,,,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:This weakness may result in the corruption of memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash. If the corrupted memory can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code.::","::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Only call matching memory management functions. Do not mix and match routines. For example, when you allocate a buffer with malloc(), dispose of the original pointer with free().::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When programming in C++, consider using smart pointers provided by the boost library to help correctly and consistently manage memory.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, glibc in Linux provides protection against free of invalid pointers.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Use a language that provides abstractions for memory allocation and deallocation.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use a tool that dynamically detects memory management problems, such as valgrind.::",::REFERENCE:CVE-2019-11930:DESCRIPTION:function internally calls 'calloc' and returns a pointer at an index... inside the allocated buffer. This led to freeing invalid memory.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-11930::,,::Memory::,::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP12:ENTRY NAME:Faulty Memory Release::,,"::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The view-1000 subtree that is associated with this weakness needs additional work. Several entries will likely be created in this branch. Currently the focus is on free() of memory, but delete and other related release routines may require the creation of intermediate entries that are not specific to a particular function. In addition, the role of other types of invalid pointers, such as an expired pointer, i.e. CWE-415 Double Free and release of uninitialized pointers, related to CWE-457.::",
