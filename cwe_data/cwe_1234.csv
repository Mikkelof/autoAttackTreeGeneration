1234,Hardware Internal or Debug Modes Allow Override of Locks,Base,Incomplete,System configuration protection may be bypassed during debug mode.,"Device configuration controls are commonly programmed after a device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (e.g., BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. This is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit, which when set, disables writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration). If debug features supported by hardware or internal modes/system states are supported in the hardware design, modification of the lock protection may be allowed allowing access and modification of configuration information.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:667:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:LIKELIHOOD:High:NOTE:Bypass of lock bit allows access and modification of system configuration even when the lock bit is set.::,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation Testing:DESCRIPTION:Security Lock bit protections should be reviewed for any bypass/override modes supported. Any supported override modes either should be removed or protected using authenticated debug modes. Security lock programming flow and lock properties should be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::,,,,,::176::,,
