58,Path Equivalence: Windows 8.3 Filename,Variant,Incomplete,"The product contains a protection mechanism that restricts access to a long filename on a Windows operating system, but it does not properly restrict access to the equivalent short 8.3 filename.","On later Windows operating systems, a file can have a long name and a short name that is compatible with older Windows file systems, with up to 8 characters in the filename and 3 characters for the extension. These 8.3 filenames, therefore, act as an alternate name for files with long names, so they are useful pathname equivalence manipulations.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:41:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Windows:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Modify Files or Directories::,,::PHASE:System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Disable Windows from supporting 8.3 filenames by editing the Windows registry.
