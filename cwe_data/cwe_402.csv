Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,"::REFERENCE:CVE-2003-0740:DESCRIPTION:Server leaks a privileged file descriptor, allowing the server to be hijacked.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0740::REFERENCE:CVE-2004-1033:DESCRIPTION:File descriptor leak allows read of restricted files.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-1033::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Resource leaks::,,,
