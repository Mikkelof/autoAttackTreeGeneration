Even with random inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::",,::REFERENCE:CVE-2006-1902:DESCRIPTION:Change in C compiler behavior causes resultant buffer overflows in programs that depend on behaviors that were undefined in the C standard.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-1902::,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:ARR32-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure size arguments for variable length arrays are in a valid range:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:ERR34-C:ENTRY NAME:Detect errors when converting a string to a number:MAPPING FIT:Imprecise::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:EXP30-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side effects:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:EXP33-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not read uninitialized memory:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FIO46-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not access a closed file:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT34-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not shift an expression by a negative number of bits or by greater than or equal to the number of bits that exist in the operand:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT36-C:ENTRY NAME:Converting a pointer to integer or integer to pointer:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MEM30-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not access freed memory:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MSC14-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not introduce unnecessary platform dependencies::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MSC15-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not depend on undefined behavior::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:MSC37-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that control never reaches the end of a non-void function:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::,,,
