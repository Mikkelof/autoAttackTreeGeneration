This could create a denial of service problem.::,"::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.

That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).::",
