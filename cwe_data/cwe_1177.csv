1177,Use of Prohibited Code,Class,Incomplete,"The product uses a function, library, or third party component that has been explicitly prohibited, whether by the developer or the customer.","The developer - or customers - may wish to restrict or eliminate use of a function, library, or third party component for any number of reasons, including real or suspected vulnerabilities; difficulty to use securely; export controls or license requirements; obsolete or poorly-maintained code; internal code being scheduled for deprecation; etc. To reduce risk of vulnerabilities, the developer might maintain a list of banned functions that programmers must avoid using because the functions are difficult or impossible to use securely.
